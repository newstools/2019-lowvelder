The workers were retrenched and the court noted that the shift patterns were introduced as an alternative to retrenching the workers. The court noted that when a reasonable substitute, based on the employers operational requirements are given as an alternative to dismissal and the employees refuse to accept the alternative offer, dismissal will be justified.
