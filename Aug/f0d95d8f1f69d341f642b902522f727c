 According to Maryke Wasserman, accounts and marketing manager, for the past three years they have successfully held annual health awareness days in April. She said, based on research as well as visitors’ and residents’ feedback, they have identified the need of an event that will showcase all the services and products from their suppliers.  The invited guest speakers were Ginette Wells, who spoke on the topic of medical aid and retirement, Collette Wright (Alzheimer’s diseases and dementia), Dr Elize Kruger (psychology of aging) and James Olckers (staying safe in the
digital age). “We invited these five guest speakers to discuss trending topics all related to ageing. This was another first event to be held in the Lowveld and we would like to make it an annual event on the local calendar,” said Wasserman.
