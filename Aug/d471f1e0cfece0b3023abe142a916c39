 MBOMBELA – The Mpumalanga Youth Choir (MPYC) travelled to KwaZulu-Natal to perform with one of the most famous school choirs in the world last weekend. The MPYC, the North KwaZulu-Natal Youth Choir (NKZNYC) and Highveld Youth Choir (HYC) were invited to perform with the Drakensberg Boys’ Choir at Em’seni near Winterton, KwaZulu-Natal. The choirs were asked to be part of a fundraiser for Mountain Mites, a crèche close to the Drakensberg Boys’ School. The MPYC consists of children from the Lowveld and Highveld. The Lowveld members left Mbombela last Thursday and travelled by mini-bus to eMalahleni where they spent the night at various Highveld choir members’ homes. On Friday the choristers met at Hoërskool Patriot and travelled to Em’seni Campsite on the foothills of the Drakensberg. The choir spent Friday late afternoon practising. The MPYC visited the Drakensburg Boys’ High School on Saturday morning. The Mpumalanga, Highveld and Drakies choirs participated in a mass practice session. On Saturday afternoon, the fundraising show was held at Em’seni. It started at 15:00 with an outdoor performance of a cultural programme. All four choirs participated. At 16:00 the formal programme commenced in the Drakensberg Boys’ High School hall. First the HYC performed. Then it was the turn of the MPYC, followed by the NKZNYC. The guest choirs then shared the stage with the Drakenberg Boys’ Choir in a mass performance. About 250 concertgoers enjoyed the performances.
