 BARBERTON – The dry and cool winter weather again attracted scores of geologists from all over the world to the famous ancient rocks of the World Heritage Site this year. Prof Christoph Heubeck, long-time friend of Barberton and one of the driving scientists behind the geological aspects of the Barberton-Makhonjwa Mountains World Heritage Site, said it was encouraging to see that these strata continue to reveal new information and insights about the processes of the early Earth and other planets. “As we walk the hills and slopes of the Makhonjwa Mountains today, we constantly think of recent insights from space exploration, microbiology, chemistry, or volcanology, much of which we are accessing through digital media.” ALSO READ: Eighteen-year-old banned from matric farewell after traces of dagga is found in her urine Last Sunday, Heubeck led a one-day field trip focused on traces of life in the rocks along the Geotrail. He sees a particular upside potential in collaboration across the border with Swaziland to integrate the spectacular but widely unknown geology there with the better-known geology in the World Heritage Site in South Africa. “We all hope that the road from Bulembu to Piggs Peak will be paved soon. It would create a wonderful transnational tourist experience and complete the R40 Geotrail across the mountains,” he said. ALSO SEE: Ready, set, bet for charity
