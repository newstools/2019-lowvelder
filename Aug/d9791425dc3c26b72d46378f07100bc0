 A very special guest was entertained at Skukuza recently. None other than Prince Albert of Monaco was the guest of honour at the Species on the Move 2019 international conference hosted at the Nombolo Mdhluli Conference Centre by Rhodes University and the University of Tasmania in Australia. The conference took place from July 22 to 26 and was opened by Prince Albert on Monday. The event brought together scientists and natural resource managers working in the disciplines of global change, biogeography and evolution, and relevant to contexts of natural resource management, biodiversity management and conservation, as well as theoretical ecology.

Additionally, the pervasiveness of range shifts from poles to the equator and depths of oceans to mountaintops, provides us with an unique opportunity to advance our theory of biogeography, evolutionary ecology and macroecology.

This interdisciplinary conference developed connections between these parallel streams, and across temporal and spatial scales.
