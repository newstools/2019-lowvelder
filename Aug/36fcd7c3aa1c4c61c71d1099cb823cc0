 Saturday’s inclement weather suspended play during the TSA Grand Prix tennis tournament. The weekend’s tennis action was held at the Nelspruit Tennis Club, Hoërskool Nelspruit, Matumi and Curro Nelspruit. When the rains cleared on Sunday, it was back to the courts for the players, who waited for them to dry before play could resume. The Grand Prix is a Tennis South Africa sanctioned tournament and the players served up a tennis spectacular at arguably one of the most important tennis events of the year. The courts were a flurry of action as the players volleyed the ball across the court and back to move up the rankings. Henco du Plooy.
