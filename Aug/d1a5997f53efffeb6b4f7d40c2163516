 Arrive Alive states that unfortunately motorists cannot predict every emergency situation, and there is often little one can do to avoid them.

With this said, it is important to have an emergency kit. Here are eight things to keep in mind, according to www.arrivealive.co.za:   1. Your kit should be kept with you in the vehicle at all times, and should consist of various things ranging from water, a coat, sensible shoes, a blanket, a torch, money and a cellular phone. These may well be the best items to provide comfort in an emergency situation.
2. Should your vehicle break down, pull over, turn the hazard lights on and call for emergency assistance.
3. If someone offers to help, stay in your car and roll down the window only a few centimetres.
4. If someone tries to get into your car, attract attention by sounding your horn.
5. Never accept a ride with someone you do not know. No matter how friendly the help may seem.
6. If you have a flat tire in a dark or dangerous location, drive slowly to the nearest service station or public place. Even if you ruin the tire, you will not have risked your life.
7. If your car is rammed from behind and the hit seems to be deliberate, stay in the car with the doors locked. Wait for the police to arrive.
8. Do not assume that an unmarked vehicle with flashing lights is a police car. Keep on driving slowly until you can pull over in a well-lit area such as a fuel station.
