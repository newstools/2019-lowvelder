 The briefing, route schedules and starting times were part of the banter over coffee at Eastview Motorrad, the sponsors of this fun event. Riders departed from 08:30 at one-minute intervals on a scenic 185 km route, with some navigation required as not to get lost, this being a cardinal sin when it comes to economy runs.

The route had to be completed in two hours and 27 minutes. Every minute over earned a 500ml fuel penalty added to the fuel used; so being late was not an option. Paolo Rondini from Maputo achieved the best overall result on a BMW F800GS with a fuel usage of 3,85 litre/100 km. In the 800 to 1200cc class, Mier Simpson beat the guys with 4,56 litre/100 km.  The pillion class was the biggest and most hotly contested affair, with Rocco and Kelly on a BMW R1200GS LC using only 4,65 litre/100 km. Johan Bezuidenhout Snr on a Can Am Spyder achieved 5,92 litre/100 km and Johan du Plessis used 3,94 litre/100 km on a Kawasaki Versus 300 that should do better next year when the new motor has had a chance to get more run in.  Four scooters entered the scooter class on a shortened route of 95 km going directly from White River to Sabie, with Jacques Robinson on a Yamaha BWiz 100 using 2,2 litres to complete the route, giving him a 2,32 litre/100 km usage. Why are we all not riding scooters? Prize-giving was a fun affair at the Sabie Brewing Company with good beer and food. The class winners walked away with vouchers sponsored by Eastview Motorrad.
