 BARBERTON –  Shaun brought home three gold medals. Two of these were for his performance in the 100-metre and 200-metre dash and the other was for being part of the Africa soccer team, which came first. According to Lindie Ehlers, school principal, for one to be able to go to the ISC, you have to attend the All Africa Student Convention (AAST). On this occasion (AAST), learners have the opportunity to receive an ISC nomination based on their performances. At the convention, pupils participate in various items, which vary from sports, culture, and arts on which they are then judged,” said Ehlers. Shaun was nominated to attend the ISC this year.
