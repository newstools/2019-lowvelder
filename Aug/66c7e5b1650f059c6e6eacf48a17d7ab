 In honour of Breastfeeding Awareness Month, Lowvelder asked Van Heerden Pharmacy to help us answer the most commonly asked questions from breastfeeding mothers.

It requires energy and dedication to be able to get out of bed every two hours, lift your shirt in public, accept that you will probably always be a smidge late, and worst of all, always having sore breasts.    Breastmilk contains protein, sugar, fat, antibodies, and white blood cells, which includes everything your baby needs when looking for a well-balanced diet. The longer you breastfeed, the more benefits your little one will gain. Expressed breastmilk can be refrigerated for 5 days, frozen for 6-12 months, and stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours.

With my firstborn, I just could not, but the secondborn I could breastfeed (and I will do it all over again). The bond you have with you baby is just amazing; your baby benefits so much from it as well. It’s not easy at all, but with a husband and good friends I pushed myself – the goal was six months, and we went all the way to 22 months. Worth every late night.
