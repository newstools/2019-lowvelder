 MBOMBELA – The local leg of the annual competition took place yesterday. Pitch & Polish founder and Raizcorp CEO, Allon Raiz, shared tips on preparing a pitch. 1. Understand who you are pitching to. What are their values and priorities? Do some research. 2. Structure it. A good pitch tells a story. Start with the problem, offer your solution at a profit, and close with how you have the ability to deliver it. ALSO READ : Anderson Street, a one way to a dead end due to criminal activities 3. Create enough of a tease in your pitch to solicit the clarifying questions you would like to answer in more depth afterwards. 4. Present only the headlines when talking about numbers. Investors will ask for details and ensure that you have these ready. 5. Prepare specific adjectives for points in the pitch, but outline a broad skeleton focused on your timing rather than the verbatim words you will be using. Enquiries: pitchandpolish.com.
