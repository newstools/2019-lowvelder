A leopard found himself in quite the predicament when he was caught surrounded by a pride of lions. The leopard kept a watchful eye on the lions, but the cat finally snapped. The pride eventually gave him the chance to escape running after him, but failing to catch him as sleeping on the warm rocks was far better than chasing an intruder. Hopefully, the brave cat learned his lesson because it is doubted that they will be this lenient the second time around. ALSO WATCH: Lion takes on kudu in the KNP
