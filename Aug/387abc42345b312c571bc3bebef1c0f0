 SKUKUZA – This is how Trevor Barnett, a Kruger National Park (KNP) fanatic, described a sighting he experienced two weeks ago when a honey badger killed a massive python. Barnett recorded this fight to the death while he was driving in the H1-4 from Satara to Olifants camp. “I am always an early riser when I am in Kruger. It was about 06:45 and I was about 30 kilometres from Satara when I saw a vehicle standing next to the road. The people told me they saw a python fall out of a tree.

As I have learned over many years as a wildlife photographer – especially in Kruger – I sat and waited. It was then that I noticed the full-grown honey badger high up in a tree searching for something,” said Barnett. The badger was inspecting every branch in the tree and it even climbed right to the top. Barnett said he immediately knew the badger was looking for the snake.
After a few minutes the badger jumped out of the tree and attacked the python.  “The light-footed badger was snapping at the python’s body. I estimated that the python was about six metres long. “The fierce little fellow would jump in, bite the snake and, as quick as lightning, would jump out of the way of the snake’s gaping mouth.” ALSO READ : MEC warns public of increase in drowning Barnett says the snake looked and acted a bit flustered, which he believes might have happened when the massive snake fell out of the tree. He says the fight lasted for about 20 minutes.”By that time, the python’s thick body had several injuries and was torn apart in some places. The reptile’s intestines were also hanging out.” The badger eventually managed to grab the python by the head and kill it. The badger then dragged the snake deeper into the bush and feasted on his meal.
