 People from all walks of life came together for a good cause at the CANSA Community Fair on Saturday.
The event, in aid of CANSA Lowveld Care Centre, was held at Baronmere Farm, the home of jewellery designer, Jenna Clifford.    It was organised by Clifford, Megan Palmer and Brenda Archdeacon under the theme “Winter Picnic”.
It was a great breakaway for the entire family, while raising funds for CANSA Lowveld and creating awareness about cancer.

The previous one was held in October last year. According to Palmer, this year’s was better attended. “The funds raised are also more than last year. The guests loved and enjoyed the wishing well, they bought tickets and won prizes,” she said.
