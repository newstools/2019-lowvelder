 GRASKOP – The rescue of a German tourist after she plunged down a cliff at Lisbon Falls was captured on film on Wednesday. Deon de Bruyn, from the Graskop Conservancy, could not believe his ears when Bianca Müller’s companion alerted him to her having fallen between 30 to 40 metres. She was lucky to escape the ordeal with only a few fractures after being trapped in the ravine for five hours.
De Bruyn was taking a video of birds from the opposite side to where Müller fell. The rescuers worked tirelessly to bring the injured tourist to the surface. ALSO READ: WATCH: Wildebeest helps injured opponent

“I was busy filming when I saw the woman, accompanied by a male companion, stepping onto the cliff. It appears as though the couple were trying to take a selfie with a GoPro camera when it fell. She reached for the camera, lost her footing and slipped.”  A tree branch stopped her fall about 40 metres down. Rescue services were called to the scene. They arrived at around 18:00 and devised plans to get her out to safety.  ALSO READ: WATCH: The countdown to the Mpumalanga Show 2019

“The side of the cliff from which she fell is a sheer drop, but her husband was with her all the time while about 30 rescue personnel worked tirelessly to get her to safety,” De Bruyn said. “It is a miracle she survived.” The point from where she fell was unsafe and the rescue was conducted from a higher position, about 70 metres above where Müller landed.
