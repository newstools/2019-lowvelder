 Betty Pretorius, owner and manager of Extreme Signs, was announced as the new leader of the South African Council for Businesswomen (SACBW) Nelspruit at Barnyard on Friday. “We welcome Pretorius as the new leader. We also identified a few ambassadors in the Lowveld, who were nominated at the event,” said SACBW spokesman, Odette Hartzenberg. She explained the event held at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre was a way to celebrate womanhood. “It was held in an informative presentation style, along with some socialising,” she said.

This was followed by a gin tasting by Dollie’s Gin, allowing attendees to make a toast to all the special women in their life. “The event was mostly about treating and spoiling women. Discovery gave us a breakdown on life insurance and claims involving women.    They also shared information about the role that women had in the 50s looking after their husbands, and how this has changed over the years. We enjoyed some popcorn, coffee and doughnuts for breakfast before the gin tasting,” said Hartzenberg.
