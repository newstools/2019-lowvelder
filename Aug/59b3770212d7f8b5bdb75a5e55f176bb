 If you have not experienced the magic of alfresco dining in the streets of the city, you have to do so at this year’s Night of 1000 Stars. This annual event has grown into one of the most popular dining experiences in the Lowveld and takes place on September 6. Once again, beautifully decked tables and a multitude of sparkling lights will line Sonpark Boulevard. Local restaurateurs have the opportunity to impress guests with a themed three-course meal. Tables are decorated according to the general theme of the night, and guests must also dress up accordingly.

Local songstress Natascha C will grace the stage with a few sultry jazz numbers when the band takes a breather. The event is held to raise funds for CANSA, and R160 of every ticket will be donated to the charity to support the many services it renders to the public in the Lowveld. A portion of the funds raised is earmarked to do screenings for skin, prostate and breast cancer, as well as Pap smears.
