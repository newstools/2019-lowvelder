 MBOMBELA – Inner creativity was unleashed during the Nine Lives of Business event at MICA Nelspruit last Thursday. This South African Council for Business Women networking initiative aimed to encourage sisterhood and mutual support by businesswomen. The evening’s creativity can be attributed to an inspirational presentation by Sandra Jacobs and a talk by Sarah Koster. It was a learning curve for local women, as the speakers shared tips and empowered them with plans for the future. They explained all these under the metaphor of a cat’s nine lives. According to Jacobs, creativity is something that we have, not something that we acquire. During her presentation she used pictures of cats to illustrate all nine lessons.

Challenge yourself a little bit; try to learn something new every day that will improve your skills.” Jacobs said fear is paralysing. Her advice is to approach life like a kitten.

This included showing women how they can draw pictures of a cat by starting with a teardrop. Guests learned other creative things such as DIY projects, including painting their own mugs, before they enjoyed some delicious soup and sherry.
