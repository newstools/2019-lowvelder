 MBOMBELA – The 40th Nelspruit Eisteddfod kicked off on Monday and proved that the Lowveld has an abundance of talent.  This week the arts and culture festival started with the English Drama and Speech category. Celeste de Lange, Denise Armstrong and Marcelle Pincus did the judging.  On Tuesday, De Lange adjudicated the drama groups. “It was absolutely beautiful,” she congratulated the groups. “Please remember that whatever you say, clarity of speech wins the day. If you do not have this clarity, you lose the precious message you are trying to get across.” ALSO READ: Stigter van Nelspruit Eisteddfod deel kosbare herinneringe  The individuals also showed what they were capable of. De Lange commended them for their articulation and facial expressions that added to the poems they were delivering.  “Remember to say the words correctly. If you are saying the word ‘long’ you cannot say it shortly. You have to stretch it out a bit.” On Monday, the dance categories kick off. Entrance to the venue is free and the competition starts at 08:00 every morning. ALSO READ: #NelspruitEisteddfod40: Meet the English Drama and Speech adjudicators
