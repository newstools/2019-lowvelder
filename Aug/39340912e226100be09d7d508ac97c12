 The Spioenkop Road (turnoff from R538 between White River and KMIA) is currently closed due to hostile protest action. At noon today (Friday August 30) Jo Pelser from AfriForum White River reported from the scene that protesters were burning tyres on the road and throwing stones at vehicles.

An eviction order was obtained and handed to representatives of the trespassers by the sheriff of the court this morning, after which the violence erupted. By noon only one SAPS vehicle was on the scene, with too few resources to properly defuse the situation. Reinforcements from the national Public Order Policing (POP) were awaited at the time.
