 Meridian Karino is preparing their learners for the 21st century. This term, the school introduced a robotics class as an extra-mural activity. The programme is meant to help prepare learners for the fourth industrial revolution. According to Johannes Sithole, head of Meridian Karino Primary School, the intensive programming involved in robotics prepares the learners to fully participate in the ever-changing 21st century.    This is also part of their preparations for the annual Curro Robotics and STEAMD (science, technology, maths and design) contest.

The school has started preparations with our grade seven learners, although they will be participating as grade eight learners next year. We will be the first Curro Meridian to participate in this and we are really looking forward to the event,” Sithole said.   “This is the century in which almost everything is computerised and the programme introduces them to new career possibilities – other than the typical doctor or mechanical engineer. “It gives the pupils an insight into the technology behind things such as self-driving cars, Q-Bots and most artificial intelligence,” he explained.
