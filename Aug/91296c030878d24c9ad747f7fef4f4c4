 On August 14, Pediatric Care Africa paid its first visit to Magalela. “This was our first visit to introduce our NGO to them and to first hand ascertain and discuss their needs, especially regarding the children residing there,” Dr André Hattingh, the organisations executive director and founder, said in a press release.  “We ascertained that there are 90+ children living at this squatter camp and that they have no easy access to a clinic or medical treatment for sick children as their nearest clinic is in White River, about 10 kilometres away. We will continue to assist this community with their medical and dietary needs of the children as and when possible.” ALSO READ: Pediatric Care doctor shows his steel in Mozambique According to Hattingh, they delivered +- 1 200 kilograms of food and clothing to the residents of Magalela squatter camp. “Most of the clothing they received was a generous clothing donation we in turn received from Katoen.”  Hattingh stated that the people living at the camp were very friendly and that they were received with open arms and warm smiles.
