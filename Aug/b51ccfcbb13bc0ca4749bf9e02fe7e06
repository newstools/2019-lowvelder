 Total South Africa has recently announced that it will donate approximately 100 000 litres of jet fuel per year to the SANParks air wing over a period of three years. This year’s shipment was delivered to the Skukuza airport just in time for a handover ceremony on World Ranger Day. The company’s new range of collectable posters was also handed over to SANParks at the event by Reina Cullinan, corporate communication and marketing manager. The SANParks air wing in conjunction with the various other anti-poaching teams, special rangers, the South African National Defence Force and the SAPS has evolved into a focused and dedicated anti-poaching support and anti-poaching response role in the Kruger National Park (KNP).

It is deployed daily in various supporting roles, specialised operations and aerial support, all needing masses of fuel. The posters depict various biomes of specific areas within South Africa and arrange the animals atop a map or graph, which details and highlights a unique characteristic of each set of animals based on where in South Africa they come from.

Through the augmented reality you can also listen to the sound of the general ambience of each biome which further creates an immersive experience.
