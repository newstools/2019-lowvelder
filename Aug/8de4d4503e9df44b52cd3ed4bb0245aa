 The Phakisa Pumas honoured their younger fans on Saturday. When the Pumas and Toyota Cheetahs players ran onto the pitch at Mbombela Stadium each held the hand of a local child, all aged six to 12. With the Pumas and CANSA sharing the colour pink, the local branch of the organisation came on board for the occasion. Spectators could, for a small donation, have their hair coloured pink. Each child wore a Pumas T-shirt and a CANSA bandana. It was a special touch to the Phakisa Pumas’ last group stage Currie Cup match of the season. The 46 children enjoyed every moment.
