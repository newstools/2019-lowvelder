 According to a press release by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Nyathi was arrested in Rietboklaagte near Acornhoek after the police received information that he was in possession of a pangolin. Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, for both their scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and their meat, which is a high-end delicacy in China. During the trial, Nyathi pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations made against him. Advocate Ansie Venter showed evidence of a pangolin that was found in a drum in a back room of the accused’s house that was apparently released after receiving treatment at a game reserve. He was found guilty as charged.

In the statement the NPA said that it was satisfied with the sentence, as it sent out a message to society that any harm caused to endangered species will be dealt with harshly.
