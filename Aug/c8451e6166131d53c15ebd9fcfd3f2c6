Cellular base stations are the only form of connectivity available to many communities, and when criminals target these base stations to steal diesel, power cables and batteries, they can cut off hundreds if not thousands of people. “We repeatedly see situations where people cannot make emergency calls and are put in danger by these criminals. Sooner or later these criminals will cost someone’s life,” said Zakhele Jiyane, managing executive for Vodacom Mpumalanga region. Each theft incident can result in the network in that area being down for days, and can severely impact businesses as well as anyone relying on the internet to study. “We appeal to members of the community to report this form of crime to police,” Jiyane said. The public can phone their toll-free number 082-241-9952 or SAPS on 10111. ALSO READ: Reward for Zander Kotze information increased
