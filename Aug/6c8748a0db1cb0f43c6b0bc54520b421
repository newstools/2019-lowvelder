 Countless homes across the UK are already making more than £1 000 per year on average with online parking portal YourParkingSpace.co.uk, which would bring down the cost of an average family holiday by almost a half. Harrison Woods, managing director at YourParkingSpace, said, “Many Brits are now returning from their summer holiday, and with fond memories still fresh in the mind, thoughts immediately turn to next year’s break. The only issue is how to pay for it? “Renting out an empty driveway to motorists needing somewhere to park is one solution, as our research shows that owners of driveways make more than £1 000 per year on average, which would make a big dent in the cost of a summer holiday.” ALSO READ: Racers kick up dust at Nelspruit Oval Track Just as significantly, these towns and cities are spread across the UK from London at the number one spot, through to Wolverhampton, which came in at the twenty-fifth position, highlighting that additional money earning potential is possible in every corner of the UK.
