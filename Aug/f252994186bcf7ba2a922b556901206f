Always park in a central, well-lit place, preferably where there are attendants on duty or people passing by.
2. Hold your keys in your hand as you approach your parked car. Do not wait until you reach the car to search for them in your purse. Experts say you are most vulnerable when you are getting into or out of your car.
3. Always walk around it to check for any irregularities, when approaching your vehicle, regardless of where you have parked it.
4. Wait until you are close to the car before unlocking it. If the car design allows it, unlock the driver’s door only.
5. Avoid conversations on the cellphone as you return to the car. This will only distract you.
6. Check the back seat before getting into the car – even if you left it with the doors locked, check it. ALSO READ: Healthy tips to consider this Women’s Month If you park on the street always choose a busy, well-lit place.
