The Naas community has been protesting since yesterday. This morningÂ residents were on their way to the tribal authority office to hand in a memorandum, following a chieftaincy row. They closed the R571 and police were dispatched to calm the situation. In the video, a man is seen running with a beer bottle in the mall, with the police van chasing him. A few minutes later the clip shows the man being hit by the vehicle.
