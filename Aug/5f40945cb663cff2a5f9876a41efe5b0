 Former Pumas sponsor Innovative Solutions Group (ISG) last week launched an urgent interdict application against Lowveld Media. ISG seeks to have Lowvelder barred from publishing its latest investigative piece involving the company. Lowvelder has been investigating ISG and reported on August 16 that it owed the provincial rugby union R500 000. The union gave ISG 21 days to deliver, whereafter it would apply for the winding up of ISG. The latter denied that it is liable for payment. Veteran investigative journalist De Wet Potgieter has since been working on a follow-up report. On Wednesday, he presented ISG’s attorney, Sean Hefferman, with a list of media queries relating to allegations Lowvelder sought to publish a day later.

The firm responded by requesting an extension for ISG’s response until Monday. Lowvelder agreed to give it three additional days and the new deadline would have been yesterday. Yet on Friday afternoon, a notice of motion indicated that, on this coming Thursday, ISG will request the Pretoria High Court to interdict Lowvelder from “reporting on and publishing an article that the second respondent intends to write concerning the applicant”.

The paper will be reporting on Thursday’s proceedings from the High Court, where the publication will fight for its readers’ right to receive information that it believes is in the public interest. Acting on the advice of our attorneys, this publication cannot provide its readers with further information before the upcoming interdict application has been dealt with in court.
