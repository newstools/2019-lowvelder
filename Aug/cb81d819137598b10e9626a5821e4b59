Traffic has returned to normal after the N4 toll road area at the Sudwala turn-off leading to Schoemanskloof was closed earlier today. It was blocked by a truck, reportedly by employees of Joubert & Seuns. Motorists are however still advised to proceed with caution when approaching Sudwala Caves turn off.
