The delectable smell of burgers filled the air at Laerskool Bergland’s grade 1E class last Friday when they became the latest subjects of a burger bust. The treat forms part of a partnership between McDonald’s Nelspruit and Lowvelder. The 48 learners were all smiles when they were informed that each of them was to be treated to a free burger and juice for lunch on the day. This Bergland class was chosen because of their best school attendance.
