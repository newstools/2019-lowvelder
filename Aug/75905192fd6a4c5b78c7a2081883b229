 Municipal manager Neil Diamond said in a statement today that the City of Mbombela is working tirelessly to restore water to White River. This came after Diamond released a statement on Wednesday stating that White River residents are advised that the raw water from the White River Irrigation Board will affect water in town. “The board has identified big holes in the canal that requires immediate intervention and repairs. As a result, the canal will be closed this afternoon to allow the system to drain out so that it can be repaired. Water will only be opened again on Thursday afternoon. The community is advised to use water sparingly during the canal outage,” Wednesday’s statement said.
