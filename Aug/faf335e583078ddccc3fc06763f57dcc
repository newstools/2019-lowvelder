 Lowveld High School’s choirs held one of their most popular events, the African Explosion, last week.
Since 2009 the African Explosion has taken place every two years. Choir conductor, Bongani Mavundla, said in its rich history of cultural activities, Lowveld High School has produced choirs that have had great success.    Mavundla said the purpose of the event is to expose learners to a project that not only gives them an opportunity to showcase their talents, but also pushes them to a level to which they might not have seen themselves at, not only musically, but creatively as well.

It is just a matter of taste and preference. Based on that, the aim was also to encourage young people to express themselves on a stage that allows them the freedom to be who they want to be.    “The concept of the event has become a far-reaching tool for the school and its learners. It is a breeding ground for choir members to share ideas in creating a showcase of which they can be proud.

There are learners that have gone on to join university choirs and have done so with distinction. “The concept came at a time when we realised how passionate learners were about being in the school’s choirs and that eisteddfods. Assembly performances and other competitions were proving not enough, as well as no challenge, and these were the only spaces for our choirs and learners to develop musically,” he explained. In the past it has featured songs from Freshlyground, Pentatonix, Lion King, Vicky Sampson, Miriam Makeba and more.
