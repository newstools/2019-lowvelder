 The day started at the Puma garage and Best Drive in the CBD. Then it was off to the venue in convoy. After the drivers’ briefing on arrival, the day kicked off with a water competition. The passenger/co-driver had to balance a bowl of water, while the driver negotiated a route of obstacles. Loads of fun was had. The course was well laid out and caught many drivers by surprise when they underestimated the terrain.  The oldest driver, in a Jimny, was 62. We stopped for a braai and lunch around 13:00, after which the activities continued. The Driver of the Day trophy went Herman Entres for a spectacular rock climb.
