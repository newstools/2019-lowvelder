 SKUKUZA – They don’t call the Lowveld lion country for nothing. While you’re out on Skukuza Golf Course, it’s a certainty that you’re going to encounter wildlife of some kind. Sometimes it’s as heartwarming as seeing a beautiful impala with her young. Other times, it could be a nasty snake or crocodile, but no sighting has been quite like the one Jean Rossouw recently had. Rossouw is the greenkeeper at the Skukuza, and upon patrol on Friday night, he spotted a leopard, then a lion came and chased it away. The video is courtesy of Latest Sightings – Kruger, and was taken by him. Watch:   Jean was doing his patrol of the Skukuza Golf Course at night when he spotted a leopard! Then a lion came and chased it away.Tinged by Jean Russouw at the Skukuza Golf Club Posted by Latest Sightings – Kruger on Friday, 8 February 2019 WATCH: Honey Badger rescues her baby from Leopard WATCH: How not to wake a lioness
