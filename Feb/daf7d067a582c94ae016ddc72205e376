 Con artists have been operating for years, however, some people still fall for them losing money and sometimes even their identity. Scammers convince their victims to trust and release their personal information or money. Such schemes gets distributed by emails, social media or phone calls. An elaborate plot for you to recruit more members to the scam. The more you recruit the more money you never receive.  This one is just cruel, especially in South Africa and our current economic situation. Work is promised, but first you need to pay a registration or training fee. Investing in a bank account that supposedly triples your investment. This long-term scam means you deposit money to support the lavish lives of scammers. Needless to say your money is gone.  Beware of fake charities claiming to help the needy with your money when they need a new surround sound in their house. Validate the charity before donating goods or money. A common one is for con artists to sell something on Facebook. They live far away from you and will courier your goods. After payment they vanish along with the purchased goods.  Oh how we would love to all get a holiday in Paris. We need to be realistic as this doesn’t happen every day, and if it does, it doesn’t require payment to claim the prize. So many people fall for this one because being lonely can be depressing. Scammers make the promise to find your true love. Long story short loneliness is still there, but the money is gone.  It is a basic rule that if it sounds too good to be true, it is. Unless you have won the lottery or done something seriously illegal, you will not turn R5 into R150 000 by trusting a scammer. Be smart – keep your money, your identity and your dignity.
