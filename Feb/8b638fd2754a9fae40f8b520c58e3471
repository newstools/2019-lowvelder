 MBOMBELA –  Thulani Nkuna was on duty in the parking bays when he assisted a person driving a silver Nissan NP200 to park.
Once the driver left, Nkuna noticed another silver Nissan NP200 parked on the opposite side with exactly the same registration number. Netstar operations manager, Vlam Els said Nkuna immediately called police and that is how he was notified.

They had registration papers which all seemed to be legitimate. Unfortunately they will experience the loss of what they paid for the vehicle.” The following day during the courtesy attendants morning parade, Els was present and handed over a monetary reward to Nkuna. “It is just to say thank you and well done. So many people must have walked past those vehicles and nobody picked it up.” He added that this had been a one-in-a-million chance. “This is outstanding work. I want to say thank you to all of you. You are the eyes and ears for us. You have an extremely important job, you must be proud,” he concluded.
