 MBOMBELA – “Although beauty is a marvellous thing, we must discredit it in human relations, since it has little to do with love or happiness.” These are the words of Helen B. Andelin, author of the book Fascinating Womanhood, that was the centre of a day seminar on Saturday.  The event, held at Hoërskool Nelspruit’s Fleur de Lis restaurant, was the brainchild of Stefanie de Kock. “The whole idea behind the seminar is to understand your husband and to find inner peace in your marriage,” de Kock said. According to her, she got the book about one year after she was married, “and about halfway through the book I started buying copies for my friends as well.” ALSO READ: IN PHOTOS: SOPA 2019 – The arrival  She turned chapters into the book into lessons for women in their marriage. She started off with women’s camps, where she presented these chapters to women along with the help of various guest speakers.  The last camp she did was last year. This year she decided to turn it into a day-long seminar. The one, held on Saturday, was the fifth of its kind and included speakers Estelle Theron, Charlotte Hugo and Eunice Combrink.  Those who attended the seminar were treated to delicious food throughout the day as well as practical advice on how to better their marriages through the teachings of the book. “What this book teaches is based on the word of the Lord,” de Kock explained and gave various quotes from the Bible that the attendees could use if they needed a little extra help.
