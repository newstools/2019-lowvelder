 Finance minister, Tito Mboweni, announced in his budget speech yesterday that all fuel levies will increase. Mboweni said that petrol levies will be increased by 29 cent per litre and the diesel will increase by 30 cent per litre. According to a statement by die Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) on their website they are relieved that Mboweni did not increase fuel levies above inflation – as has been the case in previous years – despite pre-budget speech speculation that this may have happened. “These increases will comprise anything between 40 and 42 percent of every litre of fuel bought depending on the type of fuel used and where it is purchased (either inland or coastal),” the AA explained.
