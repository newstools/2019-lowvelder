 With these words, the non-profit organisation Ntataise Lowveld’s director, Tseli Scharer, opened the educational toy and book library to seven Masoyi schools on January 23. The chairman of this 33-year-old organisation, Neil Ponting, said this NGO “has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children over the years and aims to reach another 400 000 children in the next five years”.  Ntataise has also partnered with Nal’ibali, and together their goal is to cultivate a love of books and stories. “We realise more than anything else that the foundation of all of our lives is laid in the first six years of living. We are unable to change the nature of where and to whom children are born to, but we are able to nurture and stimulate them through the proven programmes that we offer,” Ponting said. Scharer said the educational toy and book libraries are important, as play is an essential part of early life.  “They are also important as they are developing their curiosity, problem-solving, intentionality, flexibility, verbal and non-verbal skills. Socio-emotionally they are developing the children’s emotional intelligence, learning confidence, cooperation, negotiation, sharing, empathy and how to communicate appropriately,” Scharer said.  She added that the NGO strives to ensure that disadvantaged children are guaranteed a better chance of learning to read and write successfully and that this foundation be laid in the periods before formal schooling begins.
