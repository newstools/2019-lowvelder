 According to a press release issued by SAPS on February 3, the body of a 28-year-old woman who went missing on  December 29, 2018 was found buried in a shallow grave, on a farm at neighbouring Badplaas, near Carolina. The victim, Zanele Zwane, from Nhlazatshe was last seen after she reported to her family that she was going to visit her estranged boyfriend at Badplaas and was never seen nor heard from again. When asking the boyfriend, he denied that she ever arrived at his place of residence. The family then filed a missing person’s report and a police probe revealed that the boyfriend, aged 28, allegedly committed suicide soon thereafter.
