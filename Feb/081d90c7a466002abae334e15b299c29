Owner Jacques van Zyl says that him and his dad went to another Salsa branch in Johannesburg and they were so amazed with the concept, the vibe, drinks and food that they saw a gap in the Nelspruit market and decided to fill it with tacos, tequilas and more!  Salsa is not your traditional Mexican Grill. They offer truly authentic Mexican recipes, and yes, they use traditional cooking methods. In fact, they traveled all the way to the West Coast of the USA to master them and bring them back to South Africa! But, what makes the Salsa experience truly special is the inspired, healthy, modern twist that is given to each of their signature dishes. Salsa is all about freedom. Our passion for uncovering unique, fresh flavours knows no limit. Hey, if you’re feeling adventurous, you’re even welcome to create your own meal!  Naturally, only the freshest, quality ingredients, sourced from farms that meet our high ethical standards are used. Salsa supports sustainable farming, and small businesses. And, of course, no fiesta would be complete without delicious refreshments. Satisfy your thirst with fresh-pressed juices, signature cocktails and custom range of craft tequilas.
