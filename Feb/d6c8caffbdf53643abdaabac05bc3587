 This is what happened to Quentin Barnett, one of the lucky winners of SPAR’s Advent Calendar competition. The 69-year-old received his prize on Friday. The competition ran throughout December with the random, lucky draws, taking place early January to finalise all the various winners.

After 37 years of not riding a motorcycle due to a knee injury he got in a motorbike accident, winning the Harley was a dream come true for Barnett. He recently had knee replacement surgery and said this was perfect timing. Barnett bought some products at SPAR Steiltes and he sent an SMS. When he received a phone call from Odendaal informing him that he was the lucky winner, he could not believe it. “I went to the store just to make sure that it was not a scam.” ALSO READ:Win big this Christmas at SPAR Barnett said once his knee has healed he plans to join a riding club. “It will be a start of an adventure.
