 The first event in the Demacon Max Wax MTB Series offered all the thrills and mud spills for an exciting finish at Kavinga Lodge on Saturday.  Taking top honours in the 55-kilometre feature race were Christo Carelsen in the men’s and Samantha Sanders in the women’s race. With ideal mountain-biking conditions, including a light drizzle to stave off the Lowveld heat, challenging single tracks and high-speed downhills, it was a tough race with Carelsen beating runner-up Franco Pelser by less than a minute, in a time of 2:04:57. Gerrit de Vries took third. Sanders finished in a time of 2:07:50, making her the third overall winner among the men and ladies. Kirsten Gillespie was the runner-up with Claudia Slattery taking third position.
In the 30-kilometre men’s race Tiaan van Pletzen came in first in a time of 1:07:23 followed by Gert Peens and Blessing Makofane.   Jessica Svacha took the title for the ladies in a time of 1:24:42 followed by Sumanette Bredenkamp and Santie van der Westhuizen.
Micheal Meyer took the top spot in the 10-kilometre men’s race in a time of 33:35 followed by Tom Nefdt and Paul Coetzee.
In the women’s race Chanei Mostert and Zelmari van Eden were neck and neck, finishing in times of 45:58 and 45:59 respectively. They were followed by Liezel Hanekom in third. The next race in the four-part series takes place on March 2 at Pull Scar in White River.
