 BARBERTON – According to Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein he was informed that the motorbikes had been stolen in Middleburg.
“I tracked the motorbikes and got a tip off that a taxi with a trailer was transporting them on the Badplaas Road on their way to Mozambique. I called the police and Hi-Tech Security Barberton to assist me.” Gryvenstein stopped the taxi near the turn-off to Barberton in the early hours of this morning. They discovered the motorbikes hidden under blankets, luggage and food items in the trailer. The three motorbikes were a BMW, Harley Davidson and a Quad bike.
Three television sets and a computer were also found hidden in the trailer. “This is not the first time we have discovered motorbikes hidden like this on taxi’s heading to Mozambique.”
Gryvenstein urged the public to have tracking devices on motorbikes and vehicles. “This then makes our job easier to find them.”
The suspects were remanded by police and are currently in custody.
