 SABIE –  Hawks spokesman Capt Dineo Sekgotodi reported that  the team pounced on Simango and unknown number of suspects who were busy loading freshly cut railway tracks into two vehicles that were parked nearby in the Sabie area. The rest of the suspects managed to flee the scene leaving behind the loaded vehicles whilst Simango was apprehended on the scene.  It is believed that just hours earlier the group had just stripped R500 000 worth of railway tracks from the area using a blowtorch.
