 BADPLAAS – The body of a 28-year-old woman, who went missing on December 29, was found buried in a shallow grave on a farm in Badplaas. Zanele Zwane, from Nhlazatshe, was last seen after she reported to her family that she was going to visit her estranged boyfriend at Badplaas. She was never seen nor heard from again. According to Col Mtsholi Bhembe, the boyfriend denied that she ever arrived. “The family then filed a missing person’s report and a police investigation apparently led to the boyfriend, aged 28, committing suicide shortly thereafter. The probe pointed towards the boyfriend’s friend, whom it suggested may have had a hand in her murder, one way or another. The suspect eventually pointed out the shallow grave where the body was indeed found, hence his arrest last Friday,” said Bhembe.
