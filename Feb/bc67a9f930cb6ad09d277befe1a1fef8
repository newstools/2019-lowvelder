Unfortunately, some do not find their way back after the swimming expedition. We call on all communities not to expose themselves to the dangers of drowning,” he cautioned.
COGTA is responsible for Disaster Management and has established a Disaster Toll Free number as one of the life saving measures. ALSO READ: Recommendations to reduce risk of children drowning in swimming pools
Mashilo appealed to the communities to use the number to report drowning cases.
“These drowning cases can be prevented through co-operation between our communities and our government. We call on our communities to call the 0800-202-507 toll free number to save lives. We also call on parents not to allow their children to swim without supervision,” he concluded.
