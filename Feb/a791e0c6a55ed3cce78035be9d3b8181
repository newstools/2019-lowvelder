 BARBERTON – Locals are encouraged to be on the lookout for people with gardening equipment that belongs to the municipality and report them to the police straight away. This plea was made by the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) spokesman, Joseph Ngala, after 13 municipal brush cutters and a chainsaw were stolen by thieves who broke into the municipal depot. The locks on the shed where the equipment was kept were broken during the early hours of Monday. Ngala could not confirm where the two security guards were at the time of the break-in, but said a case of business robbery was opened. Barberton police spokesman, Jabu Ndubane said according to the statement, CMLM said staff locked up and left on Friday and realised there was a break-in when they arrived for work on Monday.

CMLM and the police are now investigating where the security guards were at the time of the incident.
Ngala said they were still calculating the value of the stolen items. “Such conduct is unacceptable, as this equipment belongs to CMLM. These are the incidents that delay service delivery to our people and they cannot be tolerated,” said Ngala. Nduabane said police were investigating the matter, but also urged the public to notify officials if they notice people selling the items under suspicious circumstances.
