 Here I have to make mention of Stefan Vosloo and Chris de Lange in the hot rod class. They were like two lovebirds; constantly touching and hugging. But Vosloo was not going to allow De Lange to take it to the next level and pass him, anywhere, on the circuit. What he didn’t realise, I think, was that De Lange was testing him so as to learn all his moves.  Now at the next race on February 9, De Lange is going to outfox Vosloo – you just watch this space! And then, I was quite surprised to bump into the well-known Tienie Whalstrand, the COC for this event. ALSO READ: Barry Sheen – Classic racing at its best He did not mince his words during the drivers’ briefing. He wanted a tight formation grid before dropping the green flag, and if drivers did not keep to this instruction, they would simply just do another round at idling speed.  So, when Whalstrand said, “I want to cover the grid with a Babygro (so bunch together),” that is what he got. Nice one, Whalstrand, I love the short leash! Oom Jan Buys – yes, oom for you youngsters and yes, he is about 102 and a half years old when one considers all his racing experience – drove Chris Moolman’s car and one which, it would seem, requires special skills.  Otherwise the driver is all over the track through the corners. Not too shabby Buys. You did well! Moolman in his black XR6 did well too, although I was following him with the lens waiting for him to present us with one of those Oh ^&%$# moments. ALSO READ: Vroom, vroom… Lowvelders, we’re off to the races But he kept it together, sometimes only just. At least in the time I was at the event.  Chris Moolman Jr in his Beetle had some mechanical challenges, but I am sure this will be sorted by the next event.  Rumour has it that Hanneke Brits has swapped her go-kart for a real car.  So perhaps by the third event of the season, she will set the track alight with a colourful and lightning-fast (I believe) car. So keep your eyes peeled, ladies and gents – the chicks are coming home to roost. What can you expect this season at the oval in Mbombela?  I don’t know! Everyone is playing their cards close to their chests. But, that it will be hot and snotty is certain. The next race is on February 9. • Marshall of the Year – Manie Bronkhorst
