 COROCODILE BRIDGE –  The Police earlier today confirmed that a body of a man in his late 70s was found at the Crocodile Bridge gate this morning. Col Mtsholi Bhembe, provincial police spokesman, explained that the body was discovered by rangers at around 04:00. It is suspected that the man, whose identity will not be disclosed, stopped next to the road, entered the park and committed suicide. “We suspect that he had either borrowed or rented the car in Gauteng. We believe that he shot himself with the .38 revolver that was found on the scene,” said Bhembe. The gate was closed upon guests’  arrival at around 06:00, but around 07:45, SANParks spokesman, Isaac Phaahla, confirmed that the gate was reopened for traffic. The case is now under the investigation by Malalane SAPS. Also read: Murder suspects appears in court
