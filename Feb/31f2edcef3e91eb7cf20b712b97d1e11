 MBOMBELA – The Pub owner, Ettienne Coetzee took to social media over the weekend to expose the duo who had skipped out on paying their R1 000 bill. “Watch out for these two men. They sat and drank the whole day at my establishment before they did the classic ‘dine and dash’. First the one man pretended to be going to get something out his car and vanished for 20 minutes. Then his friend walked out with his phone against his ear. When the waitress followed him, he gave her his bank card and said he was coming to pay the money now. That was already on January 14.” Coetzee phoned them since then, with each telling him the other one must pay.

Upper Deck manager, Coetzee Strydom said he had to pay after one of the men skipped his R239 bill. Dros manager, William Edwards said on January 13, the same man had run up a bill of R725,80. “He left without paying. When I kept phoning him for the money, he first told me that he was struggling and has a child to support. After that his messages became threatening.” Jock Pub and Grill manager, Maggie Chambale added that the man came there on the weekend. “We asked him to leave. The people he was with assured us that they would be paying the bill, so we allowed him to stay. They made sure he paid.” Strydom said it was unacceptable. “This is theft, and leaves a waitress or manager having to foot their bill. If you go to a shoe store, you make sure you have money to buy the shoes. You cannot just take them.” ALSO READ: COGTA warns about swimming in rivers and dams Coetzee confirmed that he had opened a police case against them.
