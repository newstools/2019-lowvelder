 MBOMBELA –  The South African bluegrass folk band, Georgetown entertained the crowd who feasted on prawns served with chicken or ribs.
Beefeater Gin also had a promotion and Lowvelders were sipping away on the cold gin throughout the day.  “We are very big Georgetown fans. We have seen them all across the country and we are very excited to see them here today,” Bianca Stevens and Ian Nel told the newspaper. Judging by the roars from the crowd, the band did not disappoint.
