 Comb what hair you have, dust off your gongs and polish your socks, it is time for the first parade of the year (pause for applause). Lone Tree Shellhole (Barberton) will once again host the Pro Patria Parade, at which we commemorate those who served their country during the Border War. Hierdie parade is oop vir die publiek en almal is welkom om dit by te woon. Die parade vind plaas in Barberton se Tuin van Herdenking om 17:00, so mik asseblief om ten minste ‘n halfuur vroeër daar aan te kom. As per tradition, there will be socialising and supper at the Shellhole after the event, and our ladies will be serving cold meats, salads, boerebrood en konfyt and dessert at around 19:00 at R60 per plate. Staying in Barberton, Moth Rob Duke of Lone Tree reports that he vaguely remembers having an enjoyable time up a mountain somewhere, sharing some True Comradeship with his fellow Lone Tree Moths during the annual Barberton Challenge MTB race.

This is the ninth year in a row that this doughty band of veterans have manfully manned that water hole…er…point. Lowveld Moths are reminded to support the “MOTH-friendly establishments” in our area, such as Gumtreez Pub & Grill in the Casterbridge Centre, where they offer a very generous discount off the bill for any Moth wearing the Tin Hat lapel badge. As you were! Jack ALSO READ: ‘n Besonderse dag vir grensmanne word gevier
