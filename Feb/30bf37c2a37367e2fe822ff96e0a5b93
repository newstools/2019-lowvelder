Here is how: • According to the Cleveland Clinic website says that it is important to get plenty of rest during the night but also during the day. They suggest that you even take a few days off work or school to give your brain time to heal. • The clinic also suggests that you avoid visual and sensory stimuli, including video games and loud music. • Mayo clinic suggests that for headaches, you can try taking a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Avoid other pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and aspirin, as these medications may increase the risk of bleeding. • Various medical websites also suggests a healthy diet and no fatty foods.
