 SABIE – Some decided to do it in a bikini, while some decided on a wetsuit. Some preferred it cold, while some longed for something a little warmer. Some screamed, some laughed, but the one thing the everyone did was have fun. This is, of course, referring to the 44th annual Round Table Sabie Tube Race that took place last weekend.  Approximately 3 200 people from all over the country showed up to take part in the famous race where you have the opportunity to float on a tube down the Sabie River.
