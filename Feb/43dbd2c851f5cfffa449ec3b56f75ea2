 MBOMBELA –   Christ Centre International Pastor Herbert  Nyakujara said the incident took place at the church  at around 22:00.  “We believe they might have been at our service which finished at around 21:00.” He said the suspects tied up the guard on duty with ropes at the back of the building. Nyakujara said  they took  the guard to the zozo office on site where they ransacked the office hoping to find some money “There was none as we never keep any money on our premises.”  “They took some groceries that we normally use to make food parcels which we give to the less privilaged in the area.” He said according to the guard, they loaded the church’s  sound system and left only the drums. ” They probably left the drums because they didn’t have enough space to put them on their bakkie.” They also took a generator, brush cutter and a tool box.

We called the police and opened a case of burglary.” Nyakujara is  appealing to members of the community who might have information or if they come across suspicious goods being sold, to please notify the police or to contact the church on these numbers:  081-747-4194 or 073-755-4478.
