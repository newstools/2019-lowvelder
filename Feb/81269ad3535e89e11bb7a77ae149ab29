 DivorceCare group will host a support group at the NG Kerk in Ehmke Street. If you going through a divorce or are already divorced you can attend. DivorceCare groups meet weekly to help you face these challenges and move toward rebuilding your life. The guests will learn how to heal from the deep hurt of divorce and discover hope for their future.  Thousands of groups meet weekly around the world. According to Debbie Stuwig, the aim is to support where there is pain. “We are a Christian support group. We want people who are going through divorce to understand that they might feel like they are alone, but they are not. There are people who can offer support. During the meeting we watch a DVD on a certain subject each week and then talk about it afterwards in the group,” she explained. Those who cannot afford the entrance fee, are said not to worry if they cannot afford to pay the R300 all at once, or to pay at all. Source:www.divorcecare.org/about
