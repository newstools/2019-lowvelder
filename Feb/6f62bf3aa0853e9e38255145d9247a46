 MALALANE – Workers at Leopard Creek Country Club had their early morning duties disrupted yesterday when they spotted a huge python wrapped around a bushbuck. According to the club director, Johan Piek, they suspect the snake had lain in wait for the bushbuck in the bushes surrounding the golf course. Drag marks indicted that a struggle had taken place, which landed the reptile and antelope on the shorter grass. The snake was startled by the arrival of the humans and slowly unwound itself before heading back into the bushes. The snake reluctantly unwrapped itself from the antelope and headed back into the “safety” of the bushes. Former English cricketer Kevin Pietersen tweeted a video clip of the incident, which received 2 658 likes and 396. Watch it below: The 6th hole at @LeopardCreekCC this morning.
