 Whether you’re planning a braai, taking part in the first leg of the Lowveld Bass Trail or indulging in the array of treats at this year’s Maroela Makiti, the weather is expected to be in your favour.  According to the South African Weather Services, a warm, pleasant weekend is expected, with a very slim chance of rain on Saturday. The mercury will rise to 27 degrees Celcius, and the minimum 19.  Sunday will be slightly hotter with a maximum of 31, with 19 also being the minimum  The South African Weather Services predicts the development of an El Niño into the southern hemisphere. In December last year, the El Niño strengthened marginally, and is predicted to last for the rest of the summer and the whole of autumn (February to April).
There is still not a typical response on the upper atmosphere related to El Niño events that affect the country.
The influence of the event is very uncertain at this stage.
The good news is that above-normal rainfall conditions are expected to continue over most parts of the summer rainfall areas during late summer. The likelihood of below-normal rainfall over the summer rainfall areas, however, become more likely during early autumn.
SAWS stated that there is more confidence in the forecasts now, due to the consistency over the past couple of months. However, due to the uncertain effect from the El Niño event, there is still relatively low confidence in the forecasts for late summer and early autumn.
Overall higher temperatures are still expected, moving towards the late summer and early autumn periods. There is a particularly confident forecast for above-normal maximum temperatures over the northern parts of the country.
In general, the late summer and early autumn seasons still indicate that wet and dry spells will alternate frequently throughout.
