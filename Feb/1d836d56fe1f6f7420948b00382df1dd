 MBOMBELA – It has been a long time coming, but the Mpumalanga High Court is complete and set to become operational. The exact date of which the new building will be taken into use has not officially been confirmed, but contractors are hard at work completing the building’s snag list. Senior foreman of Group Five, the company constructing the Mpumalanga High Court, Frans Lamprecht, and Lesego Mashigo from the implementing agent, Independent Development Trust (IDT) gave Lowvelder on an exclusive tour of the brand-new building on Tuesday.

Lamprecht explained that the court consists of two buildings – one that will be used for court procedures and one that will be used for administration.
The court building boasts 12 courtrooms, six of which will be used for civil cases and six for criminal ones. The interiors of all the courtrooms are finished in beautiful kiaat and the art and furniture were locally designed and made. Access for judges to a specific courtroom is granted by fingerprint scanners for extra protection and judges’ chambers include a separate room for their secretaries as well as their own bathrooms. The administration building is made up of four floors that are divided into a west and east wing. This hosts five governmental departments: Family Court, Insolvency Court, Master of the High Court, the National Prosecuting Authority and Legal Aid. Extra features, like a playpen for children of members of the public who visit the court, and a 180-degree view of the city from the roof of the building, will definitely establish it as a landmark.
