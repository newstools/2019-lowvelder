 Those who could not register to vote this past weekend need not lose any sleep over it. According to Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) provincial spokesman Sibusiso Nkosi, you can still register during work hours at your nearest IEC office, until President Cyril Ramaphosa officially proclaims the exact date of the election.    Ramaphosa has announced that the national and provincial elections will take place in May.
“The electoral commission hopes young voters will make use of the short window of opportunity ahead of proclamation to still register,” Nkosi said in a statement.

In Mpumalanga, 42 978 of the 51 328 new registrations were potential voters between the age of 16 and 30. “Our campaign was directed at the youth and this shows that the campaign worked,” Nkosi said. The new registrations, as well as the 132 609 re-registrations, brought the provincial total to 183 937 people who visited registration points over the weekend. This means that 71,6 per cent of the province is now eligible to vote, excluding those between the ages of 16 and 18 who will only be eligible for the provincial elections in two years.
