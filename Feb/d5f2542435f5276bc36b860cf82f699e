 I think many drivers were contemplating the COC, Tienie Whalstrand’s explanation and instruction on the meaning of certain flags during the drivers’ meeting just before the race. Often, in the heat of the moment and when the adrenaline is pumping like the Augrabies waterfall, it is difficult to control the urge to bump the driver in front or next to you, so you duck in and out with less concern for rules and safety.  This is when transgressions occur. And of course, Whalstrand does not miss much.  As has become the standard, things got pretty heated when the 1660s and two-litre class hit the track.

Whoever wants it is going to have to work for it. And Du Rand certainly did. Adriaan Bùser finished third on the day. The 1660s were all about Marius de Klerk and Stefan Vosloo, but then Chris de Lange eventually showed them off to take the number one spot for the day.

Wilmer Els made a clean sweep in this class. The next event is on March 2. If you have an itch, come scratch it at the oval track.
