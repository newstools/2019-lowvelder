 OLIFANTS – Against every hope, a giraffe that was stranded on the Olifants River Bridge for over a week, was discovered dead on Sunday. The incident was brought under SANParks’ attention on January 31. “We are aware of a giraffe stuck on an island in the Olifants. Our rangers are looking at alternatives to move the animal,” it said, but after careful consideration, SANParks decided to let nature take its course. An operation to move the animal was deemed too dangerous, potentially for the giraffe and for staff. But animal lovers failed to accept that, while others agreed that it is the circle of life to let nature take its course. The incident occurred following good rains in the Highveld and surrounding areas, and the subsequent rise of the Olifants River’s water levels. Many motorists followed the the giraffe’s predicament, and regularly posted photographs on social media. As this is a natural occurrence, we are, however, not intending to intercede in any way at the moment and will give the giraffe every opportunity to walk off the island on its own accord. We will, however, continue to monitor the situation very carefully, before considering any interventions,” it stated. But for reasons unknown, even when the river level subsided, the giraffe was unable to cross the river back to dry land, and on Sunday, it was discovered dead. The exact cause of its death is unknown, even though some said that the animal’s health and age could be attributed.
“As per our founding principles to let nature take its course, the carcass will be left in the same position to continue the natural process. We appeal to the tourists who are going to view the sight to be mindful of the park rules and not to congest the bridge so as not to inconvenience other road users,” it said.
