 ELUKWATINI – The Methodist Church of Southern Africa has joined the Elukwatini police cluster in the fight against crime. Members of the church marched to the Elukwatini Police Station on Saturday wherein they handed a memorandum where they pledged to work in cooperation with the local police in the fight against crime. Their memorandum was received by the station commander, Col Mfundisi Makamu. The church district president, Rev Muzikayise Monama, said it was high time that the religious fraternity took up arms and went head on in the fight against crime. He further alluded that the church has for a long time mixed up her priorities by focusing on trivialities and getting flat-footed on indispensables.

As a church, we too, have a role to play to ensure that women feel safe in their bodies,” said the district president of the church, Reverend Monama. Col Makamu thanked the church for being a pioneer in approaching the local police, with the intention to assist them in fighting crime, as no religious organisation had done so before.
He added that he hoped others will follow suit. “The national crime prevention strategy embodies that all entities and role players have to come together in order to fight crime. I am glad that the church has heeded the call to be our foot soldiers,” he said.
