“The matter was reported to the police at Schoemansdal, but it was impossible to launch a search for the bodies on the same day as it was already late and dark. Police divers went to the scene the following morning and their bodies were retrieved. It happened on Sunday February 03 around 14:00. On January 31 in Matsulu a nine-year-old boy is alleged to have drowned in the Crocodile River, police divers are still searching for the body. On Friday January 11, a 25-year-old man drowned at Nkomazi River, Tjakastad near Badplaas. Police divers were summoned to the scene but could not get into the river as it was too flooded.

It is suspected that crocodiles may have eaten the other part. “We plead with parents to keep an eye on their children especially after heavy rains that have burst river and streams banks. Everyone needs to exercise caution, including motorists, when encountering overflowing streams,” said Zuma.
