 The Unimog U529 is a new concept in the South African agricultural industry, offering significant farming versatility with haul speeds of up to 80km/h. The Unimog UGE529 employs a six-cylinder 7,7-litre Mercedes-Benz OM 936 Euro 5 engine, equipped with an engine compression brake and offers maximum torque output from as low as 1 150r/min, making this an remarkably flexible engine. The Unimog U529 is exeptionally fuel-efficient when compared to a conventional agricultural tractor when employed in applications requiring high speed or a high power to weight ratio. The central tyre inflation system (CTIS) allows inflation and deflation of the vehicle tyres while the vehile is in motion. The advantage of the CTIS is that it offers excellent traction, protects the soil, prevents compaction, and avoids wheel-spin leading to excessive tyre wear when operating in the field.  When operating in a high speed transport mode, the tyres are inflated on the move to highway pressures ensuring fuel economy and predictable vehicle handling. The Unimog U529 has an optimised weight distribution. providing excellent traction when required to pull hard as well as safe and predictable handling when running at high speed on the road. The key concept behind the Unimog U529 is its amazing versatility, allowing it to be used in all four seasons, fulfilling agricultural roles including manure spreading, high-speed haulage, crop spraying, fertiliser spreading, mowing, raking, baling, firefighting and combine harvester chasing. The Unimog U529 boasts the following features that make it a serious contender in the agricultural contracting and medium to large-scale farming arena:
• Forty ton gross combined weight, offering a legal payload of up to 25 tons with an appropriate trailer configuration
• Low ownership costs, and low fuel consumption when compared to standard agricultural tractors running in transport applications
• Long maintenance intervals (1 200h or one year) between oil changes
• Robust and field-proven Unimog drivetrain technology
• Central tyre-inflation system (CTIS) to reduce compaction and increase traction in the field
• High ground clearance with low centre of gravity thanks to the use of portal axles for row crop applications
• Safe high-speed capability up to 80km/h, due to truck steering geometry, two-stage engine brake and truck-type full air brake system
• High productivity due to the year-round usage potential and versatility
• Long-travel coil-spring suspension on both axles, offering excellent driver comfort and the ability to traverse rough ground at high speed. The UGE Unimog U529 is designed as an implement carrier adapted for agriculture use with the added speed of a truck and incorporates Mercedes-Benz safety technology. It is custom-built to meet each end user’s requirements and can be specified in a large number of different configurations for each customer’s exact application.

The product’s market niche is those applications where power-to-weight ratio, speed and versatility are crucial. This positions the product perfectly for applications such as spraying, spreading, mowing, silage cutting, baling and transport-style work such as combine chasing and manure spreading. The new Unimog U529 comes standard with a four-year/5 000-hour warranty.
