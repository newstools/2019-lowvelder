 MBOMBELA – According to Hi-Tech Security regional manager Callum MacPherson, a bakkie was allegedly stolen on Wednesday night at the Spur parking lot by Westend Shopping Centre. This morning at around 10:45, one of Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit’s armed response vehicles, which patrols the industrial area of the city, spotted the suspects vehicle near the traffic department’s testing grounds.  A high-speed car chase ensued. When the vehicles  got to the R40, the suspects jumped out of their moving vehicle. The one ran over the road into the bush. By then MacPherson had been joined by Bossies Community Justice and police. “Callen Herbst, Vusi Mlimo and myself ran into the bush. We managed to catch him.” At the same time, ACS Security officers managed to capture the other suspect who had fled into one of their clients yards.
The R40 was blocked off while police and security officers secured the crime scene. It was later opened for traffic.
