It’s been 26 years since a love-affair was formed between diners and Col’Cacchio’s delivering with their wholesome Italian cuisine and unique dining experience. “It’s a beautiful thing waking up everyday, excited and inspired” is how Dimitri Simitopoulos, Brooklyn Col’Cacchio describes being part of the family-style Italian restaurant.    Becoming a Col’Cacchio franchisee means becoming part of the family, with all the support and guidance needed to ensure each restaurant across South Africa and Namibia is running like a well-oiled Pizza making machine.   Kinga Baranowska and Michael Terespolsky opened the first Col’Cacchio in Cape Town. Fast forward more than a quarter of a century and the husband-and-wife pair, along with partner Greg Mommsen, have grown Col’Cacchio into a household franchise.  Col’Cacchio has always been at the forefront of dietary trends, being one of the first in the market to introduce carb-conscious options for pizza, salad and pasta. Their offering now includes gluten-free and vegan alternatives as well as high-end gourmet pizzas, pasta, salads, light meals and mains. The partners have kept the home-made feel of the food by insisting everything is made in-house. Col’Cacchio is owner-operated and franchisees are very carefully chosen. If you ask the directors what the right ingredient for a good restaurateur is, they all agree that one needs staying power. “Not only do you have to be hard working, you’ve got to be able to take the flak from the customers, suppliers and landlords. You can’t be a quitter,” said Terespolsky. Mommsen added that that when you love what you do and have fun every day, you will make it work no matter what. “It is all about the mindset,” he said.   Apart from owning their own stores the three directors are very much involved in the day-to-day running of all franchises across the region, and keep the entrepreneurial passion alive while providing support to the group with their solid business know-how and experience.  “We are more like a big family. All of the company’s directors are always available to our franchisees. We are here for them, and they know it.
I believe that you must provide steadfast support to franchisees at all times so they can achieve the success we know they can have,” Terespolsky said.
