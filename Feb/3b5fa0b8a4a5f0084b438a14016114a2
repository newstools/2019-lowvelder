 The aim of International Mother Language Day is to promote linguistic cultural diversity and multilingualism among nations.    This year’s theme is “Indigenous languages matter for development, peace building and reconciliation”. Languages, with their complex implications for identity, communication, social integration, education and development are of strategic importance for people. “When languages fade, so does the world’s rich tapestry of cultural diversity,” said United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).

This organisation found that linguistic diversity is increasingly threatened as more and more languages disappear.
