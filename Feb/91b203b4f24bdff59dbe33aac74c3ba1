A few tips to help you stay safe:
• Keep a safe driving distance.
• Drive with your head-lights on.
• Avoid speeding in the rain.
• If possible, park your vehicle under shelter and avoid driving in heavy rain. The best way to avoid being caught inside your car is to avoid water on the road all together.
Don’t drive into a flooded bridge or road, if possible, try a different route.
Listen to the radio for traffic and flood updates so as to know which routes to avoid.
For your own safety don’t stay in a car that may get flooded. Tips:
If outdoors seek shelter immediately but do not seek shelter, under a tree, under telephone and/or power lines, on hilltops, in isolated sheds, under unprotected gazebo’s or picnic shelters. Find shelter in a building or vehicle. If there is a group of low trees separate from high trees, you can hide under the low trees, however, if the tree is alone or higher than the others stay away from it. Avoid being near metal objects such as, fences, golf carts, telephone or power lines and steel structures such as pylons and windmills. Do not hold any metal object, use any electrical appliance, use the telephone or take a bath or shower. Do not play sport during thunderstorms.
If possible stay indoors well clear of windows, shelter pets and cover vehicles, disconnect electrical appliances. Unplug all electrical equipment that is not extremely important including computers.
