If you choose to make a safe room, keep a panic button or an extra cellphone with charged batteries in the room to call for help. ” He said families should prepare and plan for the probability of home invasions. “You should discuss with your children and family members about what you will do in the event of a home invasion. If you decide to make a safe room, use a room with the least windows. Many people use a bathroom.” He said a door should preferably be replaced with a steel door with a very strong lock. “Keep emergency and food supplies in the room such as medication needed and a torch as well.” ALSO READ: Five suspects break out of prison in Mbombela “Another thing is make sure the walls are also reinforced even if you use chicken wiring to do it. Make sure even if you do not have electricity that you can call for help. Speak to your security service provider to assist you with a panic button for the room.” He added that families should do practice drills to familiarize themselves with what to do. Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein agreed that a safe room was a viable option to prevent people being hurt during a home invasion. “Anything that can help in keeping people safe when incidents occur should be attempted.”
