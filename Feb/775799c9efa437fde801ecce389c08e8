 HAZYVIEW – Two suspects, Masuku Michael Rodney (33) and Ntimba Xolani Comfort (32) appeared in Mkhuhlu Magistrate’s Court after being charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.  The suspects were arrested yesterday at around 12:00, after Detective Constable Malebe Harold spotted a red golf on the R40 near Marite without registration numbers. He stopped and requested to search the vehicle. While conducting the search he discovered a firearm with the serial number filed off under the driver’s seat. “He asked who the owner of the firearm was and requested a licence, but the driver said it was the passenger’s, who denied it. Both were then arrested for possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition,” said Const Duduzile Malibe, spokesman for Hazyview SAPS.
