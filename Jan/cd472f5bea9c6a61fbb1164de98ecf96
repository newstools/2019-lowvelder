 The first pay cheque always brings excitement. It something that we all look forward to while studying at tertiary level. Due to the excitement it brings we tend to forget the basic, important things and do what we were not planning to do. Some spend their money forgetting that rent is their responsibility now.     To avoid going through these experiences, we have put together some ideas on how you can manage your money wisely: • Start saving for retirement now: I know retirement seems an awfully long way off, but it is better to start immediately so that you can get used to doing it. • Spoil yourself a little: The important words here are “a little”. It is OK to do buy nice things but do not overdo it. • Create your budget according to your circumstances: You know your circumstances, salary and needs, so make sure to remember this when doing your budget. • Set up an emergency fund: Life is unpredictable, so it is very important to always put away money in case of emergency. • Keep tabs on your spending: If you do not know how much you are spending, you will not know if you are spending more than what you have. Imagine going to a restaurant and your card gets declined. That would be embarrassing. • Buy things you can afford: This way you will be able to avoid being broke.
