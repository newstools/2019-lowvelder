 WATERVAL BOVEN – In July last year Nkomati Mine decided to undertake the enormous task of redoing the town’s main road. While citizens are excited about the new road, which was supposed to be completed by the end of December, the mine said it is not celebrating yet.  “The road is about 95 per cent done and should reach full completion by next Friday,” said Mshoza Malaza, superintendent of transformation and community services at Nkomati Mine.

Now you are no longer in need of a 4×4 to visit the town,” Pretorius said. The road is already in use and Pretorius said they hope it improves tourism as well. It was made as part of the mine’s social responsibility project, with more than 900 metres of road being tarred.  Earlier this year Malaza said they tried to keep the project as local as possible and that they joined forces with Boven Reboot as well as the Emakhazeni Municipality to ensure that the project was a success.
