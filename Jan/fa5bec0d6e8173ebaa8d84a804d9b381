 A partnership between the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL) and Services SETA has enabled over 700 learners to obtain driving licenses through a Youth Capacity Development Programme. DCSSL MEC Pat Ngomane will officially hand over the driving licenses to the beneficiaries during an event that has been planned to take place in Mbombela on January 25 at Nutting House Guest Lodge. The handing over of the driving licenses will be followed by a media briefing that will grant the media an opportunity to interact with the MEC, Services SETA management and other stakeholders that contributed to the project.

This exclusion often leads to young people not being able to participate meaningfully in the economy,” Mmusi said. It was due to these findings that the DCSSL initiated the project with a focus on Grade 11 and 12 learners. The initiative also provided for youth who had already completed grade 12 to benefit.
