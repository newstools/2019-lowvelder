 Some people might only recover from the so-called three months of January at the end of February. There are so many ways to spoil your partner on a tight budget.    Here are some ideas that you can do without spending extra cash • Dedicate a song on the radio to them: This may seem old-fashioned, but imagine your partner when they hear their name mentioned on the radio, especially if it is from someone they love. • Leave love notes everywhere: Remind him/her how much you love them and what you appreciate about them.   • Breakfast in bed: We get to be so busy focusing on work we forget the simple things, such how much a special meal in the morning can make a huge difference for your loved ones. • Cook their favourite meal: Have you heard of the saying, “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach”? Try it with your spouse.
• Rub their feet and give them a massage: After a long day at work, getting home to a massage would be nice for your spouse. Source: blissfullydomestic
