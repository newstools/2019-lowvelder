 Everyone has bad days, and dogs are no exception. According to veterinarian Jacqui Hardy of West Acres Animal Hospital, it is not always obvious that a dog is about to bite and some have been conditioned to mask the obvious signs of aggression such as barking or growling. This often happens when a dog has been reprimanded for barking or growling in the past. Therefore, it is important to be able to recognise some of the more subtle signs based on the dog’s body language to assess the situation. These include but are not limited to: • A stiff tail held in the upright position (tail may be wagging stiffly)
• Dog making direct, sustained eye contact
• Signs of anxiety such as licking their lips or yawning
• Curled upper lip to show the front teeth
• Tense, rigid posture with flexed muscles
• Raised hackles on the neck and back.
