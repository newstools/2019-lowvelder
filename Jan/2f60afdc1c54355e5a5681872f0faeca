 This is aimed at making sure that schools are compliant with the Competition Act but, most importantly, school uniforms become reasonable and affordable. The investigation into anti-competitive behaviour at schools was concluded early last year. The probe established that a number of schools still had exclusive contracts with one supplier and that these contracts did not go through a competitive and transparent bidding process. Given the number of schools and other considerations, it was felt that schools must focus on the primary function, which is to educate. The Commission was reluctant to drag these schools through the protracted litigation process and distract them from their main function. The Commission engaged all stakeholders including private schools, suppliers, governing bodies, and the government. They all agreed on the implementation of school uniform guidelines issued by the government. • School uniforms should be as generic as possible so it is obtainable from as many suppliers as possible. • Exclusivity should be limited to items that the schools regard as necessary to obtain from pre-selected suppliers e.g. badges. • Schools should follow a competitive bidding process when appointing suppliers. • Schools should appoint more than one supplier in order to give parents more options. • The concluded agreements should be of limited duration. Subsequently, the Commission signed an MOU with FEDSAS, a federation of school governing bodies, which is aimed at educating and encouraging schools to comply with the guidelines. Further, the Commission engaged private schools like Curro, Advtech and Reddam House among others. The private schools’ response and cooperation were phenomenal. Thus, they have jointly approached the Competition Tribunal and the product of their interaction will be heard on February 6, 2019. All the parties will make a joint announcement soon after the proceedings on the same day.
