 Many residents in the Lowveld regularly complain about cats in their yard that do not belong to them. Some people then set dangerous traps, poison them or try to shoot them. “It is not a good idea to do so. If you shoot the cat and it dies immediately, you still violate the law against guns. If you shoot the cat and it suffers you violate the Animal Protection Act. Either way, you are not adhering to the law,” says Nelspruit SPCA chairman, Lize Pienaar.
