 MBOMBELA – The Nelspruit SPCA has decided to stop negotiations regarding farm pound status with the City of Mbombela Local Municipality “until they comply with the contractual agreement we have on the pound status,” said shelter chairman
Ludi Botha. According to him, the municipality honoured its agreement in removing carcasses from the Nelspruit SPCA as well as paying its water and electricity bill, but it has not yet given the organisation the much-needed grant that is stipulated in the contract.

With the latest spate of wild animals on city roads, this could pose a problem. Despite challenges it is still committed to being a safe haven for all animals and currently homes a variety of farm animals even though it does not have the right equipment or adequate space. Ludi Botha. “If we have to help an animal, we will find a way,” Botha said. The SPCA is also in dire need of a new inspector after the organisation’s resigned. “For this we need about R25 000 per month.” Municipality spokesman, Joseph Ngala, chose to stick with the previous statement from the municipality. “The city is of the view that the matter between the SPCA and the municipality is governed and protected by the service level agreement. It will be highly improper for one party to discuss an agreement between two parties in the media without the consent of the other. Should the SPCA require clarity on any matter as contained in the agreement, they should have approached the City in that regard. The City remains committed to the service level agreement entered into with the SPCA.” ALSO READ: SPCA’S carcasses removed from fridge
