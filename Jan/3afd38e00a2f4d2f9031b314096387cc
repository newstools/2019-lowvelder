 Held under the auspices of Ehlanzeni Chess and hosted by Chess Unlimited Club, it takes place at Laerskool Nelspruit. The tournament starts at 07:45 but players need to arrive earlier as the registration period is from 06:45 to 07:15. The tournament is Chess SA (Chessa) rated and the format is Swiss 60/60 with three second increments. Five games are played, so expect a full day of chess.

This registration fee entitles players to compete in a number of tournaments held in the area throughout the year. Once the once-off Chessa fee is paid, players need only pay R100 for juniors and R200 for seniors per tournament entered.
