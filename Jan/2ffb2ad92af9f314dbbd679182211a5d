• During heavy rains be on special alert near dips in the highway and near low-lying bridges
• Exercise caution‚ especially at night when visibility is poor
• Pedestrians must avoid areas where water is flowing rapidly
• Keep children away from playing in drainage ditches or storm-water drains or areas where water is easily accumulated.
