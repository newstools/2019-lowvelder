 KAAPSEHOOP – You could hear the chatter and laughter of the Hazyview-based Ya-Ya Book Club from the moment you entered the Bohemian Groove Café on Saturday morning. This lively group of women had their annual get-together in this village this weekend. Jackie McFadyen and Lindy Roux. This year Bohemian owner Andrea Fourie had something very special planned for them – a scavenger hunt through town. “It takes you to all the places. At each spot you have to solve a different riddle that is unique to that specific place or to the area,” Fourie explained. The starting point was the Bohemian where the women enjoyed a champagne breakfast beforehand. They also had the opportunity to start their Saturday morning early when the Secret Sunrise event was also held in the area.

Katy Wiltshire, Michelle Pretorius and Suzy Veldsman. “We all pool money and the hostess of the evening then buys books she enjoys and hands them out to the rest of the members. After they have read them, they give them back to her,” the organiser of the weekend getaway and Ya-Ya member, Ray Roux, explained. “It is just a fun club and the weekend was an opportunity for all of us to have fun together,” Roux said. Fourie was excited about having the scavenger hunt for the first time and wants to host similar ones for anyone who is interested. She can be contacted on 076-764-7625.
