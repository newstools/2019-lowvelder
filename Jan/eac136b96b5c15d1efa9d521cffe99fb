 Although the international price of crude oil has ticked up since its low of 1 January, the overall price is still lower than December’s average, and this reflects in the current data. In addition, the ZAR/USD exchange rate has strengthened from an average of R14,44 at the beginning of the year to around R13,73 this morning. The current data showed a drop of around 12 cents per litre of petrol, 36 cents for diesel, and 33 cents for illuminating paraffin. It is expected that this figure may fluctuate in the second half of January. The Rand is continuing to firm slightly and it’s not clear what level oil will stabilise around. Whether this will work in favour of fuel users or against them remains to be seen.
