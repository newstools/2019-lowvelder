 Following the taxi accident that claimed the lives of seven people on Saturday as well as a growing concern from MEC Pat Ngomane regarding lives lost in public transport accidents, here are a few tips to keep you safe: • Do not wait for a minibus taxi or bus alone at night. Try to find out the bus or taxi schedule, so that you do not put yourself in danger. • Do not make use of any sort of public transport that has been overloaded. Rather wait for the next bus, taxi or train than put yourself in unnecessary danger. • Keep all your valuables close to your person.

Thieves are looking for an easy target. • Make use of a safety belt or handle in a train when you make use of public transport. • Let someone close to you know about your travel routine or schedule. If you do not contact them on the time you have agreed upon, they will know that you might have been in an accident and where to start looking for you.
