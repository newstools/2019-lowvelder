The Barberton Taxi Association blocked the main roads towards Barberton on Thursday morning. No motorists, taxis or buses were able to enter or leave the town via the R40 to Mbombela or the Badplaas road. The taxi association partially disrupted traffic on Monday too. Their grievances centre on taxi operators from Mbombela intruding on routes they consider theirs. Lowvelder is on the scene and will update readers about the situation as the story develops.
