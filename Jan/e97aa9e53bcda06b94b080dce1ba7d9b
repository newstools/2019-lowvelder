 MBOMBELA –  The 65-year-old pensioner, Edward White Moropane, and his police officer son, Jeffrey Micheal Moropane (42), appeared in the Nelspruit Regional Court for money laundering after they were arrested by members of the Mpumalanga Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit on the same day. Hawks spokesman, Capt Dineo Sekgotodi said it was alleged that between 2012 and 2013 the pair colluded with Cinderella Moropane (37), an employee of Eskom at the time. Cinderella submitted fraudulent invoices for services that were never rendered. Eskom lost approximately R1.8 million due to the illegal transactions. Cinderella Moropane was the first to be arrested in this case. All three are out on R2 000 bail and the case has been postponed to February 28 pending further investigations.
