 January feels long because most people had received their salaries early in December – always dangerous with the holidays sucking pockets dry – and also because there are often extra expenses with the coming of the new year.     It does not matter how many times we promise ourselves we’ll be good, we always seem to find ourselves on a tight budget every January. To help you survive, we have put together some tips to help you survive: 1. Cook your meals don’t buy takeaways Buying food may seem like a quick solution, especially when you’re adapting to the “jet lag” after holiday, but it will cost you much more. Stay at it: cook at home and keep it simple if you must, but throw the takeout flyer away!   2. Take a lunch box to work When cooking the night before always remember to leave some for the next day. Some offices provide coffee for their employees, so take some bread along to work and enjoy your cost-effective lunch.   3. Avoid social media This will help you not get trapped by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and end up spending money you do not have. Avoid the pressure on social media altogether – and save some data while you’re at it.    4. Prioritise and spend less As simple as it seems, have a list of the important expenses that cannot be avoided, such as your children’s stationery, school uniform, transport fee and petrol. Put the money aside or draw it and place in an envelope if that’s what you need, but don’t spend it on things you want.   5. Quite expensive habits Stop buying things you want, stick to the things you need. When some extra cash comes in, or you save money elsewhere, you’ll spoil yourself soon enough. For now, cut the expensive habits – you know exactly what we’re talking about.
