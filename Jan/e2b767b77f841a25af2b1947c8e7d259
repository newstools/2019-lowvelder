 BARBERTON – Learners and teachers of Barberton Secondary School are set to kick off the 2019 school year in mobile classes tomorrow. A lightning strike caused extensive damage to the school in December. A total of seven classes were totally destroyed when lightning struck the buildings and set them alight on December 20. Jasper Zwane, spokesman for education said a team from infrastructure was sent to the school to conduct a technical assessment and to compile a report for consideration by the management. “The department remains committed to working with stakeholders to resolve the current state of affairs in this school. MEC Sibusiso Malaza visited the school on December 28 to assess the damage caused and to discuss with management and members of the school governing body a plan to put interim measures in place for teaching and learning when schools reopen on January 7, 2019,” said Zwane. He said as part of interim measures, the department will temporarily set up mobile classes. The school reopened Monday and classes are expected to resume on Wednesday.

My guys got there quickly, about three minutes later. The school was ablaze already,” said Dednam. He said the lightning had caused an electrical fire so all the cables had been burned. “The top floor was burned down and the bottom floor has water damage,” he added. Dednam said the school had a good reputation in the area. “It is one of the best schools in our area. They have fantastic matric results every year. The children who attend are not from rich families. They have about 800 learners. I am worried about what is going to happen to them, as it will take years to rebuild,” added Dednam. Mthobisi Sithole, school principal, said parents and learners must not panic. “When the learners return to school on Wednesday, it will be operational. We have met with the MEC (Sibusiso Malaza) and delegates from public works to find out operational plans to renovate the schools. We agreed that 15 mobile classes and a toilet will be delivered before Wednesday January 9 to allow teaching and learning to resume without glitches on the first day,” he said.
