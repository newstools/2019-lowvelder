 On a quest to clean up the city a new initiative, We CARE 4 Nelspruit CBD, was launched this week. They were hard at work at Anderson Street and the park outside Village SPAR. Past TJ Maré, from the organisation, said after they saw how unclean the city was the Nelspruit City Improvement District, Nelspruit Community Forum and Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism decided that they wanted to make a difference.    Maré said every person who works gets a meal for their service and hard work for the day. “Everyone who works has a ticket and when they are done working for the day I sign it for them and then they will get preference when they go get their meal at the community forum.

We will make sure that those who worked will feel appreciated for their work,” he explained. This initiative is not only about cleaning the city, it is also about the people living in the city. “The cleaning that we have started in Anderson Street is important for us. We are also going to have a spiritual cleaning, as Christians we are going to pray for our city in these areas that are so dark and affected by the wrong powers.” They plan to hit the streets of Mbombela every day. “We will go from one street to another and when we are done we will start with maintenance,” Maré stated.
