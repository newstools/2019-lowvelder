 Many South Africans own television sets, but few use them to watch SABC channels or receive a broadcast television signal. Thanks to affordable, fast uncapped internet, many South Africans have shifted to streaming services such as DSTV Now, Hulu, Netflix and Showmax. This raises an all important question: Do you need a TV licence? Technically, no, but there is still a procedure to follow in order for you to have it cancelled.  In terms of the Broadcasting Act, No 4 of 1999, any person that has possession or uses a television set must have a TV licence. In South Africa, you will not be able to purchase a TV without presenting your TV licence number at the checkout counter. You will still need a licence, even if the TV isn’t being used. A TV set is any device designed or adapted to be capable of receiving a broadcast television signal.  Again, you cannot own a device which can receive a broadcast television signal. This includes a decoder or a TV set. To render your TV incapable of receiving a broadcast signal, you will need to remove its TV tuner. This has to be done by a professional, and must be checked by an SABC inspector who charges R300 afterwards. After this process you will need to send proof that your TV cannot receive a signal to the SABC annually. If an inspector comes to check, you will have to fork out an additional R300.

The form needs to be completed and sent to tvlic.info@sabc.co.za as a cancellation request. The SABC says that it reserves the right to dispatch inspectors to verify whether you still have a TV or not, and should a TV be found in your possession after the processing of your cancellation, you will be liable for the payment of outstanding TV Licence fees and penalities. Consequetly, if the case ends up in court, you could also face a R500 fine, six months in prison, or both as a result.
