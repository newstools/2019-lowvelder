A five-year old girl was mauled to death by two pitbull dogs in White River on Tuesday afternoon. According to White River SAPS spokesman Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo, the dogs attacked the little girl when she arrived at the property from pre-school with the owner of the dogs. The parents are neighbours.  Paramedics certified her dead on the scene. A case of culpable homicide was opened and investigation is underway. The dogs were taken away by the local SPCA to be euthanised and the body was retrieved by the SAPS forensic unit from Nelspruit.
