 MBOMBELA – Four provincial traffic officers were suspended from work this week after a man accused them of bribery and assault. Lindelani Shezi posted footage of the alleged incident on social media and it certainly made waves. According to Shezi’s attorney, Sandile Dlomo, Shezi had been pulled over close to Badplaas on January 10 – on his way to Mbombela for business. “He was asked for his licence by the traffic police and he gave it to them. They then proceeded to inspect the vehicle, at which point Shezi got out of the car,” Dlomo said. A screenshot from the video. He stated that the traffic officer told Shezi he had been speeding and had to pay a fine of R1 500. When Shezi allegedly asked to see the evidence on a speed camera, the traffic officer replied “unless you have something with you”. “When Lindelani asked him what he meant, he said he meant a bribe,” Dlomo related.

On the video, one can see that a fight then ensued – the officers did not want to hand his licence back to him. A statement by the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison spokesman, Moeti Mmusi, said four traffic officers had been placed under precautionary suspension pending an internal investigation. In another statement by the same department, MEC Pat Ngomane said he had seen the video and had “assembled an investigating team to look into the issue as a matter of urgency, as we view the allegations in a very serious manner.” A screenshot of the video. Dlomo said after the incident took place, Shezi had rushed to the Badplaas Police Station where they allegedly refused to assist him in opening a case. He added that after a while the same traffic officers who had allegedly harassed him, walked into the police office and after a while finally handed Shezi his licence.   This morning as I was driving from Ermelo to Nelspruit, I was stopped by traffic police and asked for a license, checked the car and then suddenly told I was over-speeding and I must come and get my R1500 fine. Ok🤔Then I was asked if I will really take the R1500 fine or do I have money on me. I refused to pay the bribe. I asked him to show me the over-speeding recording on the camera which he could not, then I felt I was being taken for a ride in Mpumalanga with my KZN-registered vehicle. I opted to record this whole thing. I was threatened, assaulted and the traffic officer refused to give back my license nor to write me the fine. I informed them I will lay charges at the nearest Badplaas police station, they even told me where the police station is. They had their identity name tags hidden. When I got to the police station a police office refused to open the case of assault, attempted bribery and theft. These traffic officers then emerged at the police station, went inside the charge office at the back office and then came out, went into their car and one of them brought back my driver’s license to me. They tried to threaten me at the police station and I refused to be intimidated.After 24 years of freedom, 1. no South African deserves to be humilated like I was. 2. We must refused to be coerced into paying bribes! 3. We must refused poor service at the hands of police officials. The SAPS police official who refused to open a case for me saying he can’t open a case against a police official committed a crime of defeating the ends of justice by protecting traffic offices from facing justice; he is an accomplice.On behalf of the many innocent citizens who fall prey to these ruthless corrupt and arrogant public officials, I am taking this upon me to contribute to the fight against corruption in the public service. My fight against this behavior is about restoration of confidence and trust in our government. It is officials like these with loose morals who tarnish the name of our government. When a member of the public suffers at the hands of such rotten elements, it is easy for people to say this is how government is treating people instead of isolating these elements from the good-meaning public servants. I am doing this for the weak, for the vulnerable and for the defenseless. I am not only exposing these characters but also taking them on throughout the justice system. I have opened a case against them. Police management and IPID must also act against the police officer who refused to open a case against his traffic colleagues. I say “not in the name of our government, not in that uniform shall we allow this” Let us join hands to put a stop in this!! Enough is enough 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿 Posted by Lindelani Shezi on Thursday, 10 January 2019 “He then went to the Ermelo Police Station, where they also did not want to assist him until I phoned and asked for assistance,” Dlomo said. Provincial police spokesmen could not be reached for comment regarding this at the time of going to press. ALSO READ: Over 120 traffic learner cops to be enrolled
