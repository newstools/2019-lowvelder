 For others it might not even be their first year, but it is never too late to correct bad spending habits. Although it may seem exciting when you see the money in your account, do not forget that that amount needs to last about 29 days. We have put together some tips to help you manage your funds and avoid being broke. Tips to remember
Draft a monthly budget: Firstly at least try to figure out what your basic needs are and what your wants are – these are two majorly different things. For example, you can live without buying a nail polish but you will need food to eat. Eat from home or prepare a lunch box: As much as takeaways are fast and so easy to come by, they will cost you. So to stay on your budget, eat before leaving for your classes and if you’ll be in class until late, take a lunch box with you.   Target markdowns and specials: If you love something but cannot afford it, wait until the item goes on sale. For example: After Christmas almost all the goodies and decorations are marked down, this applies to Valentine’s and Easter too. Get a temporary job: If you consider doing this, remember your studies are first priority. Getting a job on the side can help you be able to buy something your parents cannot afford. What’s more, you’ll appreciate the things you have more after you’ve had to sweat blood for it. Stay indoors when you are free: This decision will help you avoid unnecessary shopping and it will help you stay on your budget. Buy second-hand study materials: Second-hand books have all the information you need, don’t dodge the opportunity just because they are not new. If you take good care of it, you could also sell it when you pass the subject – win-win!
