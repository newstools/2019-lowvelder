Nomvula Zikalala said she and her family members, which include her husband and two brothers, were expecting to receive R29 500. “We all had different plans for the money. On the day we were robbed, I was happy that I was going to receive my share. Unfortunately one of the stokvel contributors sold us out. He organised the thieves to come and rob us. Sadly, the police did nothing as no one has been arrested though the people who robbed us are known,” said Zikalala. The show will be aired at 20:30 on Dstv channel 403 and 22:00 on Etv.
