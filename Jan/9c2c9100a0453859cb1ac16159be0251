 MBOMBELA – Solange Soares-Nicholson, TRAC communications officer, said they were disappointed at the notable increase in the number of accidents in comparison to the same period last year. According to Soares-Nicholson, 219 accidents were recorded between Tshwane and Maputo from December 7 to January 8. These included 23 fatalities. “Although the number of fatalities has decreased from last year, the senseless loss of lives is of grave concern to TRAC,” she stated. There were 75 accidents and nine fatalities in the Lowveld region of the N4 Toll Route. In Mozambique, 76 accidents resulted in five fatalities. The Highveld saw nine fatalities from 59 accidents. Nine accidents and no fatalities were recorded in Gauteng.

Yet high traffic volumes, driver negligence, reckless driving and the vast number of unroadworthy and overloaded vehicles on the road contributed to the increased accident count. “TRAC is deeply saddened by these statistics and conveys our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost loved ones. We also wish those recuperating from road accidents a speedy recovery.” She thanked the law enforcement and emergency services teams. “However, despite all of their diligent work, the reality is that road safety is not only the responsibility of these entities. “Every road user must shoulder the responsibility of keeping South African and Mozambican roads safe.” ALSO READ: Massive dagga plantation discovered in the Lowveld
