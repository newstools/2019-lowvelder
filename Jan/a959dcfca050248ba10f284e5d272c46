 The advert states that there is currently an intake for entry level constables and that interested individuals should go to their nearest police stations to apply. Members of the community are therefore warned that this advert is false, fake and its origins are unknown. Police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi said the last trainee intake for 2019, was advertised in May 2018 and the closing date was June 15, 2018. Hlathi said the selection process for last year trainee intake is almost complete.

Members of the community must be extremely cautious of this and other similar fake information that is posted on social media from time to time. In most cases, these adverts require people to make cash deposits. In most cases the fake adverts requires the public to use cardless services to deposit money then forward the PIN,” said Zuma. Zuma said the SAPS do not require any money for employment opportunities within the organisation, and unless an advert is posted on the official website or published in reputable newspaper, that advert maybe a scam and members of the public are advised to enquire at their nearest police station if unsure.
