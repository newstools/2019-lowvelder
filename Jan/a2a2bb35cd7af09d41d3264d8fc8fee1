 Did you know that Nelspruit SPCA has an emergency number? Their emergency phone is available on a 24 hour basis for emergencies. What is an emergency:
• An injured animal
• An animal in distress

• Animal cruelty that needs immediate attention e.g. stoning of animals, burning with hot oil or water, animal in hot vehicle. ALSO READ: Nelspruit SPCA in dire need of financial help What is not an emergency:
• An animal that was put in our overnight kennels. Your pet is safe there and can be claimed during office hours. We will book them in as soon as the staff do their kennel checks.
• Stray animals (unless they are hurt). Dogs running down the street in perfectly healthy condition is owner negligence, not an emergency.
• Barking dogs
• Crowing roosters
• Enquiry with regards to our office hours
• Enquiries on items for sale in the charity shop
• A bitch on heat
• Neighbourly disputes/conflict
• Surrender of animals ( they can be put in the holding/overnight kennels)
• Feral/stray cats living in your roof. Please take note that they are the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and it will always be their first priority. However, they request that you also take them into consideration before you make an emergency call.

It is a function of the municipality. They have a staff member specifically assigned to pick up stray animals,” Pienaar said. The SPCA emergency number is 082-755-8687.
