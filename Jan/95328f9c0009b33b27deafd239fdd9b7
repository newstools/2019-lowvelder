 When you are on a road trip you can find that you experience four seasons in one day. Richard Green, national director of the South African Motor Body Repairerâ€™s Association, a constituent association of the Retail Motor Industry Organisation, says they always receive enquiries from concerned motorists after hailstorms. Green says in the unfortunate event that you are caught in a hailstorm, here are some tips to consider: 1. Keep calm: Lower your speed and ensure your lights or hazards are turned on for increased visibility. 2. Find a safe place to pull over: Ideally it is preferable to try and pull over and wait out the storm where there is cover. You must, however, always remain in your car to avoid personal injury.

Be cautious of stopping under large trees where there is a danger of falling branches and debris: Position your car so the windshield bears the brunt of the hail, the side and rear windows are not as strong and are more prone to breakage.   4. Keep a heavy blanket/s in your boot: This will provide you with a protective covering that you can throw over the bonnet of your car to prevent hail damage. 5. If your car is damaged, evaluate your options: If you are insured, call your insurance company immediately and notify them as to what has happened. Follow their advice as each insurer has its own cover, terms and conditions and required processes to follow. Remember, in some cases you may elect to manage some of the repairs yourself, such as replacing damaged wiper blades or a smashed headlight. If you are insured let your insurance company know of your intent to do so.
