 1. Get to know your roommate and others in your residence, hostel or block of flats The people you live with, most of whom are going through similar experiences and emotions, are your main safety net. This is especially important for those first-year students who are going to stay at res where seniors can sometimes look down on you. 2. Attend your classes It may seem way more fun to sleep in or to go to a party, but attending your classes is really important. Besides learning the material by attending, you’ll also receive vital information from the professors like what to expect on tests and changes in due dates. 3. Find the perfect balance University life is a mixture of social and academic happenings. Do not tip the balance too far in either direction, as this could not only affect your grades but also your emotional well-being. Seek advice from a second-year student that you can relate with as to who they attempted this balancing act. ALSO READ: Mbombela IEB schools achieve top matric pass rates 4.
