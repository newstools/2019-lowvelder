 A video of Piet Maritz went viral after it was shared on Facebook on January 20.
In the video he is seen sitting on a bed, telling a story of how some of the nurses ill-treated him. It is alleged that certain staff members refused to help him remove his adult nappy.
Due to his illness he is unable to do it himself and he had to plead with them for help.

The department spokesman, Dumisani Malamule said they were not aware of the video and would investigate. “The only thing he wanted from them was to be assisted since he cannot do it himself,” the woman said. “After they removed the nappy they took it and put it behind the door, then later returned and made him smell it. They proceeded by undressing him then left him naked and that also made him feel uncomfortable. “His heart is sore because of the treatment he received. He is deaf and he lost his hearing when he was young. He does not want to cause any trouble for anyone, although he needs assistance while he’s in hospital.
