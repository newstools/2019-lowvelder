 MBOMBELA – Department spokesman, Jasper Zwane said the registration process had improved meaningfully this time around, notwithstanding some challenges.
DA councillor, Tersia Marshall said she had found that all the children in the Stonehenge area had been placed in surrounding schools.

He said the main issues experienced this year were of parents who were withdrawing their children from independent schools because public schools were displaying a significant improvement, and because some could no longer afford school fees.
“There are also a number of parents who are relocating to economically active towns such as Mbombela, eMalahleni, Steve Tshwete, Secunda and Standerton.”
“There are some noted movements that are necessitated by bereavements in different families. This makes it difficult to plan for such movements, hence they constrain the available resources,” he added. ALSO READ: BREAKING NEWS: Karino Fuel station bombed
Zwane said the other challenge experienced this time around were parents who, when told that schools of their preference were full, refused to opt for schools that have space.
“Be that as it may, the department is encouraged by the public confidence in public education shown by parents. Education will draw from the lessons learned this year to further improve the system for the 2020 registration process.”
He concluded that the department apologised to parents who were inconvenienced, and further thanked all principals including school governing bodies for their cooperation. In addition, it extended its best wishes to all learners and teachers for the 2019 school year.
