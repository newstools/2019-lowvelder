 We have lunch box ideas to get through what certainly feels like three months of January. Re-purpose leftovers and create a yummy lunch box: Chicken, beef or pork that was left over from last night can be used as a tasty filling for wraps or sandwiches.     Use plastic containers that are divided into compartments for the different types of food: You can reuse this as much you want without needing a new one everyday.    Buy in bulk and pack as much as you need: Buying bulk can often save you big bucks  Don’t buy veggies that have already been diced: You can chop these up a week in advance and have them ready for the lunch box the night before.    Plan lunch boxes over the weekend: This way you avoid giving the kids money to buy food at school becuase time in the mornings just run out Clear out what’s left in the fridge and cut everything into bite-sized chunks that kids will love.
