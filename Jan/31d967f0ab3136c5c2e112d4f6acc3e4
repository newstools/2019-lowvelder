 OLIFANTS – A relaxed braai at one of the most sought-after camps in the northern parts of the Kruger National Park almost ended in disaster when a fire broke out on Saturday night. According to SANParks media specialist, Isaac Phaahla, the fire broke out at around 22:00 when strong gusts of wind preceded a severe thunderstorm on the night of the incident. “An ember from the charcoal got lifted into the air and ended up on the thatched roof of one of the units, setting it alight,” said Phaahla. He added that the wind caused the fire to spread to a second unit. A witness, whose children were staying in unit number 10, recalled how the fire started at unit number 8 and spread to the ninth unit, also affecting the unit her children stayed in. All occupants managed to escape unscathed. She expressed her gratitude on social media towards SANParks and its game rangers. One of the guests thankfully immediately phoned the camp’s emergency number, which allowed personnel to react quickly,” he said. With the help of Phalaborwa fire department, volunteers and SANParks staff, assisted by heavy rain, no one was injured and the fire was quickly contained. As Olifants Camp was fully booked, SANParks relocated the affected guests to Letaba. Also read: Police looking for missing mother and son from Sabie
