 Talk to your child about school and point out all the positive things, such as making new friends and participating in sport and other activities. Buy all the necessary supplies and put your child’s name on these, as well as on his lunchbox and uniform. Write down need-to-know information, such as your contact details, and go over important safety information with your child. Try to drop your child off at school on the first day at least, even if you can’t do it every day. If you plan to participate in any carpools, start organising a week or so ahead of time. Find out whether the school has information about other learners who live in your area. Figuring out where your children will go after school can be challenging, especially if both parents work. Start arranging after-school activities or care as soon as possible.
