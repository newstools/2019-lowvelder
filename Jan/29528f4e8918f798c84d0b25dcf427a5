 MBOMBELA –   Hawks spokesman, Capt Dineo Sekgotodi said Freeman Thulani Maisane appeared in the Kabokweni Magistrate Court yesterday for murder and possession of an unlicenced firearm. Sgt Thembisile Ndlovu (40) and her husband Jabulani Khoza (44) were awoken by a disruption inside their house. “Upon inspection they were fired upon by three suspects. The late Detective Ndlovu from Calcutta SAPS retaliated and fatally wounded one suspect.” The other two armed suspects continued firing, and both Ndlovu and Khoza succumbed to injuries from the shooting. “The suspects fled the scene with the family’s vehicle, which was later found abandoned within the Bushbuckridge area.” The Hawks, assisted by the Nelspruit Tactical Response Team (TRT), arrested Maisane for the alleged murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm.
“He was found at his hiding place in Mhluzi (Middelburg) in the early hours of Saturday.” The national head of the Hawks, Lt Gen Godfrey Lebeya, has commended the investigating team for the apprehension of the alleged perpetrator and is confident that the third suspect will be arrested soon. He was remanded in custody until January 14. He will appear again today in the Mhala Magistrate Court for murder.
