 BARBERTON – The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) has assured the residents of Umjindi that all their proof of residence monies collected by a security officer were duly accounted for. These monies were collected during the December holidays at the council offices in Umjindi by a security officer from Hlozi Security Solutions, which is contracted by the council to provide security to its premises. Joseph Ngala, CMLM spokesman, said the collection took place during the closure of the office over the Christmas period when only essential services were rendered, which included cashier enquiries and issuing proof of residence.

The team experienced a high turnout of clients who needed services which prompted the senior official on duty to request assistance from the security officer, if she would not mind assisting with proof of residence. Having been familiar with the protocols and procedures and how to direct the public from the security desk, she obliged,” said Ngala. He said under those circumstances the team opted to request assistance as it would have meant that clients would have been turned away, which was not a desirable option at the time. “This was their effort to ensure that service delivery continued to be uninterrupted. We can assure our residents that the monies handled during this time were duly accounted for and that there was no intention by the staff or the security official to defraud the municipality or the public. It was just an intervention given the circumstances at the time,” concluded Ngala.
