MBOMBELA – According to Hawks spokesman Capt Dineo Sekgotodi, it is alleged that the members demanded R200 000 from the victim on Friday in Mbombela. The victim is from Swaziland and has a trucking business.  The businessman allegedly gave the police members  R15 000. “He agreed to give them the remaining money the following day. The victim asked the police to meet him at Jeppe’s Reef border and he then reported the matter to the police in Swaziland before he made the rest of the payment. Swaziland police alerted the police at the border who then made arrangements to arrest them.” The suspects will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate Court today.
