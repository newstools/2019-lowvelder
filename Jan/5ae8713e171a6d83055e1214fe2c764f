 MBOMBELA – According to police spokesman Col Mtsholi Bhembe, the arrest of the suspects came after community members accosted the couple and questioned them about the death of their 18 year old grandson. “Subsequent to the interrogation, the community members took the law into their own hands by setting the couple alight with tyres. Police were summoned to the scene and they rescued the victims, the police discovered that the act by the community was sparked by the discovery of the body of the young man on the bushes not far from their house.” The elderly couple is currently in hospital under police guard where they are recuperating. Preliminary investigation indicated that the young man may have allegedly been poisoned. Two cases have been opened for investigation, one for murder (against the couple) as well as two counts of attempted murder (against the mob). Police are currently looking for the suspects responsible for setting the couple alight. Anyone with information that may assist in the investigation of these cases is urged to contact Det WO David Mathebula on 082-462-2416 or the SAPS Crime Stop number at 08600-10111. The Provincial Police Commissioner Lt Gen Mondli Zuma appealed to members of the community to desist from taking the law into their own hands, but to report wrongdoers to the police. The practice of vigilantism is not only illegal in the country, but also dangerous as innocent people often bear the brunt of mobsters.
