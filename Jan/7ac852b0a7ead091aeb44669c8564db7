 It was all smiles when around 120 grade ones made their way to Curro Nelspruit to officially start their school career on Wednesday. The school was abuzz as parents accompanied their little ones to their respective classes.
“The lack of tears can be attributed to a meet and greet that was held at the end of last year,” said the phase head, Amanda Hinsbeeck. This, however, did not help the parents who swallowed hard as the children did not even look back on their way to greet their friends and favourite teachers. One set of twins, Luthando and Tando Ngala, started in their respective grade one classes. Off the bat, Hinsbeeck had to assist pulling Nathan Mckenzie’s tooth, which was carefully placed in a special pouch for the tooth fairy. She said that she is excited to spend the year with the new arrivals.
