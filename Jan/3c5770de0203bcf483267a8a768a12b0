 MBOMBELA – Police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi said police had arrested a 37-year-old man, while a number of accomplices are still sought in relation to the death of two men aged 24 and 29. He said in a statement that information at the police’s disposal suggested that the two victims were picked up from a section called Etinkomeni in Msogwaba and taken to a secluded place where they were severely assaulted until they died. Their bodies were then abandoned on the street. He said the murder stems from developments where the arrested suspect’s house was broken into between the evening of December 30. Subsequent to that, the suspect and a number of his friends conducted their own investigation. “It is as a result of such unauthorised investigation that led them to the two victims. Hence the acts of vigilantism and their subsequent death, with their bodies being dumped close to the road around the area.” Police were alerted by passers-by who spotted the bodies. An investigation was immediately launched, which pointed to the suspect and his accomplices. Police arrested the suspect and more arrests are imminent. The provincial commissioner of the police, Lt Gen Mondli Zuma, appealed to members of the community to desist from taking the law into their own hands, rather to report and leave criminal matters to the appropriate authorities. Anyone with information that may assist police to investigate or lead to the arrest of the outstanding suspects, is urged to contact Capt Vusi Thobela at 082-469-1956 or the SAPS Crime Stop number 086-00-10111.
