 BARBERTON – Emjindini Traditional Council headman, Sunduza Nkosi said the unveiling of graduates who benefited from the Barberton Mines bursary scheme should be seen as a shining light to the drug-ravaged community of Emjindini. He said the local community of Emjindini was under siege from the scale of substance abuse. Nkosi, a retired principal from Chief Funwako Secondary School, said the local schools and young people were the worst affected. He was speaking during the Barberton Mines Excellence Bursary Awards held at Barberton Town Hall on Tuesday.

My plea is that, these graduates could have been presented in public where many people, especially the youth, could have been present. They (graduates) are our shining example of our community. Their presentation in public could have been a motivation to those who are involved in social ills and not taking their studies seriously,” said Nkosi.
