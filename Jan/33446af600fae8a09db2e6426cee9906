MBOMBELA: Earlier today, SANParks confirmed that no guests were able to enter or exit the Kruger National Park through Numbi Gate. According to SANParks media specialist, Isaac Phaahla, the matter has now been resolved. The delays were caused by the community adjacent to the Kruger National Park, who embarked on a strike this morning. The exact cause of the protest is unknown. Phaahla said that guests can now enter and exit the Kruger National Park through the Numbi Gate as usual. Also read:Â Self-confessed arsonist remains in custody
