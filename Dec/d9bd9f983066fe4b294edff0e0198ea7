 Just remember, before you make any homemade treats for your pet, check what foods are hazardous to dogs. Making your own dog treats might not be as convenient as quickly popping into the pet store, but there are more options when you opt for homemade treats. You can also avoid any allergens, make them as healthy as you want, and cater to your dog’s specific needs. Always be sure to check with your vet with any specific concerns. Dog friendly cinnamon rolls are made with whole wheat flour to make them extra healthy. ALSO READ: Why do some people hate Christmas? 3 cups brown rice flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 egg
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup water • Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside. • In the bowl of a stand mixer (or using a hand mixer), combine all the ingredients until dough comes together. If the dough is too crumbly, add more water one tablespoon at a time until moist enough. • Scoop about a tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball (about one inch in diameter). Place on prepared cookie sheet and flatten with the palm of your hand until about 1/2-inch thick. • Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until the treats are golden brown. Let treats cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. ALSO READ: Holiday road safety
