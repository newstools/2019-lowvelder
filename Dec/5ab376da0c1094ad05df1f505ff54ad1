 The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is urgently calling on Group O donors to donate blood to meet demand. According to SANBS there has been an increasingly high demand for blood in hospitals, leaving Group O blood stocks at a low. As a result of the low blood stocks, SANBS is appealing to members of the public to visit the nearest donor center as soon as they can. Group O is considered the universal blood group, because anyone regardless of blood type can receive type O blood without risking a transfusion reaction.

Mlambo said the best gift you can give anyone is the gift of life.
“We know that South Africans have huge hearts and we call on them to fully embrace the spirit of Ubuntu by giving their blood donation today.” ALSO READ: What is the 16 Days of Activism?
