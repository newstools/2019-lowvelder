 MBOMBELA -Pieter Burger, the CEO of Mpumalanga Rugby, confirmed to Lowvelder that their liquidation application was the first of the two-part legal process, which has been concluded. “We still need to decide if we want to pursue a damages claim against ISG,” he said. ISG is a Gauteng-based company that provides staffing outsourcing solutions, finance, administration and taxation services. They were announced as the main sponsor of the Mpumalanga provincial rugby team in 2018. Lowvelder previously reported that ISG and its owner, Arnoux Maré, were unable to fulfil its sponsorship obligations to the Pumas rugby team.

On September 11, the Johannesburg High Court heard the case for the liquidation of ISG after they allegedly failed to pay the team’s sponsorship fees.

Burger told the newspaper that a confidentiality clause was added to the settlement, which prohibits the disclosure of any part of the agreement. It was also confirmed by an attorney on Burger’s legal team, Bradley Scott. “It is an expensive exercise to bring an application in the High Court,” Burger stated. “Our legal team will evaluate the merits of such a claim, in December or possibly early next year, in order to determine if it will benefit the union financially.”
