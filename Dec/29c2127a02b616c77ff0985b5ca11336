 The four accused were arrested in two separate incidents and appeared in the Skukuza Court in January and February respectively. “We can confirm that the four are now back at work,” said Reynold Thakhuli, acting head of corporate communications, SANParks. In January 2019 the media reported that Nzima Joe Shihlangu (32) and Lucky Mkansi (30) were arrested on January 15 after authorities believed they were allegedly involved in rhino poaching incidents at the Kruger National Park (KNP).

In a separate incident, Hendrik Silinda and Musa Mlambo were arrested in February in the park on poaching-related incidents. Thakhuli added that bail conditions are set at the discretion of judges, and that they were not aware of any changes to them thus far.
