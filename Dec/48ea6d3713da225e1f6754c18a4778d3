 Nedbank LVCC Marathon Club’s best athletes were rewarded at their year-end function and prize-giving at the clubhouse on Saturday evening. The evening had a fitting superhero theme, with club members dressing up as Hulk, Thor, Superwoman and even Die Swart Kat. 2019 was a good year for the club. It was the first time they hosted five races, adding the Mopani in September to their line-up. “It takes a lot of commitment, which is not easy,” MC Mark Greeff commended the members. Professer Mthethwa was named the male runner of the year for breaking the Uniwisp Kaapsehoop Marathon course record and reaching a brilliant finishing time of 6:04 at the Comrades.
