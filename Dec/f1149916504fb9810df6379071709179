 That is why Lowvelder consulted renowned Lowveld photographer Johan Orton, to give us a few handy tips for better selfies. 1. Use a selfie stick. As soon as you hold the camera too close to you, you tend to get a fish-eye effect which might add some weight. 2. Always take a selfie facing the sun. This way you will use the available light to you advantage and keep shadows to a minimum. 3. Golden hour! The ideal time for selfies is between 05:00 and 07:00 and 17:00 and 18:00 – known as golden hour. Natural light during this time provides the best natural, most subtle light. 4. Look for three elements to include in your photo. Classify yourself as one element and add two more. Examples of such are windmills, reflection of a sunrise or sunset – or whatever fits your location. In the Lowveld for instance, you would want a picture with Jock, or a waterfall, where as on the South Coast you would want to pose at a waffle house – something unique to the area. 5. Facial expression is essential – look happy and excited – show your teeth. ALSO READ: Safe driving tips for women this festive season 6. Use background items to you advantage – like the Tower of Piza, or pretend like you’re holding the sun – remember to do the latter during golden hour. 7. Aim you camera upward. Orton is of the opinion lower angles works best for selfies. 8. If you see a celebrity, use it to you advantage – most of them do not mind, and it is the best way to attract your followers’ attention. 9. Use your rule of thirds. This basically means dividing your phone’s screen into thirds, and using one third to place yourself in, and another two to place your other two elements. 10. Finally, Orton suggest using animals in the picture. “Animals just tends to make it cute,” he said. ALSO READ: Top activities for children this festive season
