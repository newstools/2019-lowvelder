 Current Regional Court president, Naomi Engelbrecht, had made a low-profile decision to close this court and move it almost 100 kilometres away from the Kruger National Park (KNP) to Mhala Magistrate’s Court.  People close to the fight against poaching, specifically rhino poaching, were surprised by the decision, as the court had been vital in reducing rhino poaching statistics. Legodi intervened after the matter had been brought to his attention and sent through official communication that the court was to proceed as normal. At the time he assured that he had started an investigation into the matter.

Legodi then told Lowvelder that he had requested Engelbrecht to provide a written motivation for closing the court without reverting to the stakeholders who took the decision two years ago to continue using Skukuza Regional Court. The meeting on Friday was then called to find an amicable solution. Legodi confirmed that he had sent the outcome of the meeting to KNP’s Nicholus Funda. Funda could not be reached for comment at the time of going to print. Skukuza Regional Court is renowned for fighting rhino poaching.
