 A large group of motorcyclists got together to show their support for the cause against violence towards women and children on Monday. About 74 motorcycles gathered at Crossing Centre for a 430-kilometre mass ride. They visited various towns, travelling to Badplaas, Machadodorp, Dullstroom, Pilgrim’s Rest, Hazyview and back to Mbombela.

We cannot allow a society in which they are mistreated and manhandled.   “For some women the situation gets to a point were they cannot go to work due to domestic violence. And some children will be scarred for life because they have to see men and women fighting and a woman being brutally treated. This can lead to a society ill. Let us say no to violence against women and children, and report it,” he said. They also collected hygiene items that were donated to GRIP. “Let us respond to the call to assist organisations such as GRIP,” Maré said. “The organisation needs a lot of support from the public to make their centre work and GRIP is a victim support centre.

It is one of the big challenges that they have.” Maré thanked everyone who participated and promised that more of these events will be organised in 2020.
