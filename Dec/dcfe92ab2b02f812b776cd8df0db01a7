 The partnership will also enable the SAWC to offer their conservation and natural resource management students training on EarthRanger. Through this new partnership, the SAWC will offer EarthRanger deployment, configuration, and support services at local rates to wildlife reserves, protected area managers and staff. It also allows the SAWC to include EarthRanger as part of their training curriculum to serve communities across Africa. This offer enables an increasing number of conservation professionals the opportunity to implement EarthRanger as part of their daily work.  “The SAWC’s Applied Learning Unit has been set up to help address current and pressing conservation challenges. What is clear across many, if not all of these challenges, is that the conservation industry could benefit greatly from more efficient collection and use of good quality data. Technology is becoming an increasingly vital part of wildlife conservation and it’s the cooperation and involvement of companies like Vulcan that make it possible to expand access to training for rangers and conservation professionals,” said Dr Cleo Graf who leads development at the SAWC’s Applied Learning Unit.

EarthRanger is an easy-to-use software solution that helps protected area managers make informed operational decisions for wildlife conservation. Real-time data from ranger patrols, remote imaging and a growing list of sensors can be visualized and analyzed in context with historical trends, animal movements, and ecological changes. By working closely with operational staff on the ground and making the collected data easily available for integration and sharing, EarthRanger empowers the safeguarding of our world’s wildlife and habitats.
