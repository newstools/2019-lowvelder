 The staff and family members of local law firm, Hough & Bremner Attorneys, pledged their support to the Nelspruit Hospice as part of their annual charity drive by donating much-needed supplies and lending a hand to clean patients’ medical equipment. Nelspruit Hospice provides quality palliative home care for patients suffering from life-threatening diseases like cancer.  In consultation with their doctor, Hospice personnel perform regular patient checkups, administer prescribed medication, care for wounds and more – offering critical support for families and ensuring a better quality of life for patients in need.  The hospice is managed by two wholly dedicated and qualified staff members, Landi Bezuidenhout and Elmarie du Toit, but is currently severely short-staffed and in dire need of more caregivers and volunteers to adequately reach and treat the 50 to 60 patients that require their services and ongoing care. ALSO READ: Ready, set, bet for charity Nelspruit Hospice is a non-profit organisation that relies solely on the support and donations from local companies, businesses and individuals to cover their monthly expenses, which average around R65 000 per month. Hough & Bremner Attorneys would like to appeal to the public to join them in supporting this very worthy cause. If you would like to pledge your support, either through donations or volunteer work, please contact the Nelspruit Hospice on 013-744-0095 or email reception@nelspruithospice.co.za.
