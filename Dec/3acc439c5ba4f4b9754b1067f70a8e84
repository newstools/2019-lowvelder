 MBOMBELA – A massive fire continued to rage north of White River on Sunday morning. The Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association (Lefpa) said the blaze started in the Witklip area.

On Sunday UniquesAir assisted with an additional bomber and Working on Fire with a spotter plane.  Firefighters said it is the first time in 24 years that they are facing such a large fire in the Lowveld in December.
