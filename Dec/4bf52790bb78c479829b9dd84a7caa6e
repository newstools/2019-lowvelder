Clarke said the angel Gabriel had given each and every animal in the barn a special heavenly job to do.     “The fireflies brought the stars so that they could show everybody where the stable is. The sheep went to fetch their flock and shepherd to keep baby Jesus warm. The owls were to find the wisest man in the land, because owls are wise. Angel Gabriel brought all the other angels to bring the music, which we all enjoyed, and he sang alone, too.

The message of the play was: “It was such a heavenly, wonderful experience to be in the stable with Joseph and Mary when the baby was born.” She said she was grateful for all the support from the teachers and staff that went along with her idea of the play.
