Ike Phaahla, communications manager for the KNP, confirmed that tourist monitors and traffic police have been instructed to have zero tolerance with traffic offenders. “Appropriate speeding fines will be issued by officials. We will recommission traffic cameras, which were out of order for a period, on November 18.
