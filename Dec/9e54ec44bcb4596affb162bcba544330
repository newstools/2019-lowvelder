This has contributed approximately nine cents in price relief. Meanwhile, the landed price of fuels has been mixed, with petrol down slightly, while diesel is up,” says the AA. The Association says the Rand is on an impressive run of stability which dates back to the start of November, with the trend very slightly stronger against the US dollar. In addition, basic fuel prices have also kept within a fairly narrow band which has insulated the motorist against the kind of steep price swings seen earlier in the year.  “Although there has been a slight upward oil price trend that has manifested over the past few days, it is too early to tell whether this will persist. Barring any unforeseen surprises, we expect 2020 will kick off with only modest fuel price changes,” the AA concludes.
