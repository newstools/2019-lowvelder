 MBOMBELA – Over the past few weeks, Mbombela has seen steady downpours, which are a welcome respite from the searing heat. Rain, however, means wet and slippery conditions on the roads and an increasing number of car accidents due to poor visibility. According to a report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation,  Mpumalanga Province recorded 1 182 road accidents two years ago. This number decreased to 1 048 last year, with a number of factors such as hit-and-runs, driver fatigue, mechanical failure and jay-walking pedestrians, among other things, contributing to the death toll on our roads.
