Tourists travelling to Mozambique are waiting for several hours, in queues stretching kilometres, to cross the Lebombo Border Post. Solange Soares, spokesperson for TRAC, confirmed that the N4 is experiencing heavy traffic towards the border post. “We have done all we can to improve traffic accommodation for peak traffic times. However, we can not control border operations.”
Soares added that the gridlock is between Komatipoort weigh-bridge and Mananga IS.
Traffic from the border towards South Africa is diverted via Mananga IS.
