 The Paper Manufacturers Association of South Africa estimates the amount of paper and paper packaging in the country to number over 12 million tonnes. These numbers reflect the recycling numbers over the past ten years. Overall, it puts the last year’s number at 71,7 per cent. According to PAMSA, this figure compares favourably with international trends and ensures that  the recycled paper is transformed into new products and does not end up in the landfill. China has introduces stricter conditions for cleaner waste products two years ago. This means that about 30 million tonnes of paper is in need of a new home. The stricter requirements have resulted in decreasing waste paper prices.

This could potentially be a boon for the agricultural, manufacturing and retail sectors. There are challenges though, and the country need to research and develop new uses for recovered waste paper during this economic downturn which has seen lower production by local paper mills using waste paper as raw material. To this end, PAMSA’s producer responsibility organisation, Fibre Circle, has set aside R2 million to research and develop alternative and ingenious ways  to use waste paper.
