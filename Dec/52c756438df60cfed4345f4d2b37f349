 The Nkomazi Local Municipality (NLM) approved the Nkomazi Special Economic Zone (SEZ) development last week. If all stakeholders meet the conditions of approval set by NLM, Komatipoort may soon become a changed landscape, unlocking development and jobs. This small town had been identified as an agricultural and industrial business zone by the government years ago. Drought and reduced sugar cane prices have cost agricultural Nkomazi dearly. So did the International Monetary Fund intervention to general trade when it prohibited the transferring of money from Mozambique into South Africa. The need for added value in Nkomazi is urgent. Therefore the approval in principle of the Proposed Township Establishment on Portion 58 of the Farm Komatipoort Townlands 182-JU, to be known as Komatipoort Extension 20, is important. This development could well invite business
to the region. ALSO READ: Mazda reveals first electric vehicle The developer assured that all relevant demands or pre-conditions for the development have been considered. The following conditions of approval have been made applicable: • Proof of a water-user license indicating that sufficient water is available to the township prior to any construction. • Sufficient electricity provision exists and will not impact the existing and developing Komatipoort.
• The waste water treatment works will be installed to the satisfaction of NLM and the Department of Water and Sanitation prior to any construction.
• Adequate provision has been made for the parking of trucks and large vehicles from a traffic-flow and customs point of view.
• Phasing of the township must be defined prior to proclamation of any part thereof.
• The services agreement with NLM should outline the services to be provided for and maintained by the developer.
• The developer clearly indicates the manner in which SARS and Customs will be accommodated on site.

According to Jan Engelbrecht and John O’Reilly, Komatipoort business owners, as much as the hard work of the deployed staff is appreciated, more is necessary. “That is why we requested the introduction of the City Improvement District mechanism to have a hand in matters that cannot wait for municipal action.” The chamber will arrange a public meeting as soon as the CID invite is accepted.
