On these days, all of its response units – in collaboration with emergency services such as the SAPS, paramedics, fire and rescue and provincial traffic – will be deployed to strategic points along the route – Bronkhorstspruit, Middelburg, Milly’s, Mbombela, Hectorspruit, Komatipoort and Matola Weighbridge (Mozambique) – to enhance incident/accident support,” she said. “Extremely heavy traffic is expected en route to the Lebombo Border Post in Komatipoort. TRAC has, over the past few months, issued warnings about the heavy truck delays at the border and again warns members of the public of the current status quo. Road users are urged to note that although delays at the border impact traffic flow on the N4, border-clearing processes do not fall under TRAC’s jurisdiction or responsibility and it cannot be held liable for, or assist with, backlogs relating to this.” “However, TRAC will work closely with the Lebombo border control operational coordinating committee and Ressano Garcia Border officials to assist with traffic management measures to improve traffic flow. This includes the provision of several logistical items and road user information.” ALSO READ: SANParks warns holidaymakers of road closure in Kruger National Park Although the Lebombo and Ressano Garcia Border posts will be operational 24 hours, from December 13 to January 13, road users are advised that traffic management operations will be implemented from today.
