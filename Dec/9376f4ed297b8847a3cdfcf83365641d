 Christmas is the time we tend to eat more than we’re used to – and why not?  We’re celebrating and spending special time with our families. This dessert is not only very easy, it is also a healthier option. First off, you’ll need meringue cups – these you can buy at your local supermarkets. Next you’ll need a bag of frozen mixed berries.

Make sure you only add the berries to the meringue right before you serve, or else they’ll go soggy. Leave the berries in the fridge overnight to defrost. To add some extra pizazz, you can make a berry sauce. Boil three cups of mixed berries in a pot with half a cup of water and a pinch of salt – you can also add some honey for a little extra sweetness.  Boil for five minutes, turn off the heat and mash the berries with a potato masher. Then boil for another two minutes and remove from heat. The mixture will thicken as it cools. Add the berries into the meringues, drizzle with berry sauce and serve immediately. ALSO READ: Five quick gift wrapping ideas for Christmas
