 With predictability comes peace of mind, which is why KIA Motors has decided to increase the value proposition of its evergreen KIA Picanto range with the inclusion of a standard two-year/30 000km Service Plan. There are many benefits to a standard service plan on the KIA Picanto, with one of the main advantages being the ability to plan ahead for the services your car will need – and knowing how much you will need to budget.

There are exclusions for certain wear and tear items, but the full extent of what is covered under the service plan is contained in the service plan documentation supplied to the customer on purchase.
