Alas, it is not all sunshine and daisies – rainfall and all sorts of bugs are imminent too. Unfortunately, mosquitos are part of the package, so be prepared for the Great Itch of the season. Although not very prevalent in the southern regions of Mpumalanga, there are still cases of malaria reported every year transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito.  Higher risk areas include but are not limited to: Mozambique, Botswana, Northern Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Mosquitos thrive in areas where they have access to open bodies of water – that beautiful water feature or fishpond may be just what they need! Fortunately, malaria is preventable; ask your pharmacist at Mopani Pharmacy about malaria prophylaxis.  Make sure your first aid kit/medicine cabinet is stocked this festive season – for the accidental scraped knee or headache – and of course, something to repel the buzzing beasts of the night. Luckily, Mopani has everything you need – suitable to protect everyone in the family, from Baby Benny to Grandma Sue!  Mopani Pharmacy stocks it all; anti-mosquito lamps, protective netting for baby-campers, insect repellent spray for all ages, patches and candles. Of course, we also have some soothing ointments and creams, in case one of the little flying friends do make it through the defences.  Also, be sure to stock a Malaria Rapid Test Kit – it sells for only R49,90 and has a shelf life of 24 months. It has a sensitivity rate of 99,9% and specificity of 99,1%. Consult the Mopani Pharmacy Wellness Clinic sister about the safe and accurate use of your kit. Malaria may present itself with symptoms common to influenza such as intermittent mild fever, headaches, and muscle aches but with the guidance of Mopani’s trusted experts and a malaria home test kit, your festive season can be enjoyed with one thing less to worry about.
