 MBOMBELA – The medical manager for Hi-Tech Security, Frederik Esterhuizen, stated that you will need to check your brakes, the tread on your tyres and your shocks before you drive in wet conditions. “In rainy weather, worn shocks will leave your vehicle vulnerable when you aquaplane and it may result in a serious accident,” he said. “Not only do motorists have to contend with flooding, and heavy downpours which affect visibility, many traffic lights are out of service due to the bad weather. The problem is further exacerbated by the rolling blackouts which mean many street lights aren’t working either, making driving not only tricky, but dangerous,” warns the Automobile Association of South Africa (AA). Motorists will further need to be wary because road conditions can change within a few hours. “You must be prepared at all times” in order to avoid swerving out for potholes and into incoming traffic, the AA stated.

Maintain your vigilance while on the road,” the AA concluded.
