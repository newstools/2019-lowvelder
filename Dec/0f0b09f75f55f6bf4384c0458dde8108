 The function held at Emnotweni celebrated its fourth anniversary this year. The event has grown in leaps and bounds to feature in seven different cities. On the last leg of its tour, it returned to Mbombela to tantalise the palates of locals. Debbie Combrink, the CEO of Invictus Events and Entertainment, and organiser of the show, said, “It is great to be in Mbombela. SPAR is our title sponsor for the event and we want to bring a little taste of what the Cape winelands have to offer to local residents”. Combrink said the bulk of the vineyards are located in the Western Cape. “There are real undiscovered gems.” The Olive Brook pairing stand from TOPS at SPAR gave a unique glimpse into the exotic art of pairing the appealing aromas of certain wines with certain foods, for a taste bud explosion.

The wine is described as having “a marmalade and honeycomb aroma, with a hint of ginger, all of which are prominent on the nose,” by Paarl winemaker, Natalie Kuhne. Mbombela residents Rolene Smith, Camila van West and Carmen Morgan all agreed, “The few wines that we had tasted are excellent and the atmosphere is great. Wine is always good with good company”.
