 SAPS spokesman Brig Leonard Hlathi said, “Police have since opened a case of murder in this regard and are adamant that the suspect(s) must be brought to book.” Hlathi said preliminary investigations also suggest that the victim was a government employee attached to the Mpumalanga provincial government. “Information at the SAPS’ disposal indicates that at about 22:50 Ngale was with his friends at a sports bar and he stepped outside after receiving a call. Subsequently, there was the sound of a gunshot outside and Ngala ran back inside but collapsed on the floor,” he explained. “Reports indicate that another man who was in possession of a firearm followed shortly and went straight to the victim and searched him.
