 An act of kindness has changed the way one local woman and her family view things. Paula Da Silva was so inspired that she shared on the Facebook group #ImStaying how Thabo Makau recently saved her daughter’s first baby shower. Makau is the manager at Coffee Couture, the coffee shop in Mediclinic Nelspruit. Da Silva said things appeared to be falling apart when her daughter, Vania Zweers, who is expecting her first born, had to be rushed to the hospital on November 28. Her baby shower had been arranged for November 30.

The family was worried that they would have to have a baby shower in 24 hours – without Zweers. “We were sitting at Coffee Couture when my other daughter suggested that we do it there. We had already planned everything. All we needed was a venue. Makau agreed to let us use the venue without charging us a cent.” They decorated the area, brought in their own arranged food and added some drinks from the coffee shop. Although Zweers ended up being discharged just before the shower, they decided to stick to the new venue and she got an amazing baby shower.

One would blow up a balloon and then carry on serving customers.” Makau loved the experience too. “It was our first time doing something like this and it was amazing. When they explained to me that they planned everything and were worried because the mother-to-be could not be there, I saw it fit to help them make the day a success,” he said.
Zweers and the baby are doing well, and she is expected to deliver in January.
