 This is a result of shortage of capacity, with a number of generating units still out of service due to breakdowns. The improvement, however, is largely as a result of several units being returned to service. “Breakdowns are at 12 900MW as at 08:30 this morning,” Eskom mentioned in a press release this morning. “We continue to use diesel for our open-cycle gas turbines and water at pumped storage schemes to supplement capacity. Eskom warns that any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in a change in the load-shedding stage at short notice. Here is the stage 2 load-shedding schedule for today: 07:00 – 09:30
