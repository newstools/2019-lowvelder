 BELFAST – “The man was arrested last Friday in Machadodorp, after intelligence received indicated that on December 26 the suspect forcefully raped his victims at their place of residence in one of the rooms, while threatening them with a knife,” Brig Leonard Hlathi, the provincial spokesman for the police, said.

The officers pursued the alleged perpetrator after seeing him fleeing from the victims’ house. The SAPS then promptly stormed the house to apprehend the suspect and confirm the horrendous act. “The police opened two rape cases and detectives from the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offenses Unit were immediately assigned to investigate the matter,” Hlathi said. To add insult to injury, the assailant disclosed while in police custody that he was a parolee and had been convicted on a murder charge, Hlathi said. Hlathi indicated, however, that upon thorough investigation, it was discovered that the assailant was not a parolee and that he had used this false information to intimidate others. “He was arrested alongside his friend for murder in 2003, and his friend was found guilty and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, later released on a warrant of liberation in 2008. “The suspect was acquitted on the murder case in 2005, however, somewhere in 2017, he was again arrested for shoplifting where he was fined R100,” Hlathi revealed. The accused will remain behind bars pending a formal bail application on January 7. ALSO READ: Police to investigate bomb scare at station
