 A roadblock on the R40 brought unexpected cheer to motorists travelling into White River on Wednesday morning.  Instead of the expected fine from a reprimanding traffic officer, they received vouchers from local businesses and bottles of water. These vouchers included a variety of things, from discount on fuel at the Sasol garage, to dinner at Premier Hotel The Winkler.  This feel-good venture was organised by the local tourism council in conjunction with the police, traffic department and security companies.

Estelle Roe, of White River Tourism, said they also aimed to make the public aware of the visibility of the police and traffic department on the roads, which would in turn hopefully lead to less dangerous driving and fewer accidents.  The bottles of water were to remind drivers to hydrate while travelling. “More than 240 bottles of water were given away within the first hour of the roadblock.” ALSO READ: Petrol price set to decrease in January 2020 However, it was not all fun and games, as the police also made use of this opportunity to search suspicious vehicles. Nothing was found on the day, but it served as a reminder to would-be criminals that there will be a large police presence this festive season.  The traffic department issued a handful of fines, including for transgressions such as driving without a license plate or with an expired driver’s license.  Roe confirmed that the roadblock was planned to become a regular event. The next one is planned for Easter. “Any local businesses who want to join us are more than welcome,” she said.
