 BARBERTON – Today marks 234 days since the former Lily mine workers camped outside the mine following its closure. For the 50 or so miners permanently camped there, this will be a bleak Christmas. The group’s spokesman, Harry Mazibuko said, “Last Thursday, a delegation from SSC Group visited the camp and gave us about 600 food hampers which we distributed to those in attendance. “The remainder we transported to our former colleagues in Nkomazi and Barberton who were unable to attend the
meeting.”  ALSO READ: WATCH: Roadblock brings unexpected joy According to Mazibuko, the food hampers were well received by the protesting mineworkers. “We are grateful and excited. The response was great and the people were appreciative of the donation. This Christmas will be a black one for us because we have nothing.” He added that, after a series of meetings, the contingent has decided to take it upon themselves to retrieve the container in which three of their colleagues perished on February 5, three years ago. “When we started this protest, bringing back the bodies of Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda,
was always the plan.  ALSO READ: Mpumalanga DG resigns “Mine management obtained a legal interdict then to prevent us from doing so, but after recent discussions, we have
resolved to take it upon ourselves to get their bodies to the surface.” According to Mazibuko, as experienced miners, they have the know-how to conduct the operation independently of the mine’s owners. “We know exactly where the container is and what safety protocols to follow. Nothing has been done to continue the
search for them.  ALSO READ: Keep your kids busy this holiday “All we have seen is appeal after appeal with no result. If this continues much longer, 2020 will end and still nothing has been done.” The miners plan on going underground tomorrow to start the search.
