 Claire Cobbledick, GM of Gumtree, people can easily spot which toys did not live up to the hype by analysing the listings on the site. Cobbledick said there are a few tips parents should deploy before shelling out on big presents. “Kids outgrow toys quickly. Before committing to a big-ticket item, shop secondhand. You can teach healthy money habits by having your child sell their old toys to buy new ones. Make a point of donating or repairing old toys rather than throwing them out.” ALSO READ: Penryn Preschool’s nativity play capture spirit of Christmas   According to an analysis on the site from 2018 to date, the following toys are the most frequently listed for sale: • Hatchimals: These adorable animals remain a surprise until they noisily hatch from their eggs, but that is usually where the excitement begins and ends. • Build-a-Bear: Similar to Hatchimals, the fun of this toy lies in putting it together and customising it. • Hoverboards: This was all the craze in 2018 but frustrated parents started listing their hoverboards on December 25. “Last year we had dozens listed by Boxing Day for half price,” says Cobbledick. The cause is unknown but reports of injuries and accidents might be behind the steep abandonment rates. • Lego: Lego is incredibly popular, but once assembled, pieces invariably go missing and the novelty wears off. • Battery-powered cars: Car enthusiast parents will shell out thousands for mini Ferraris and BMWs for their little ones, but they often end up for sale soon after. “The batteries need to be replaced, kids lose interest or simply outgrow them.” ALSO READ: Generosity saves Natureza’s Cat Rescue Source: Gumtree
