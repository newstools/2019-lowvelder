Your cultural background is not sufficient to understand humanity.” She added that between all of the religions, races, languages and etiquette, it is sometimes hard to be accepting of things and people that are different, but if you learn more about the how and why each culture became the way that they are, you can learn to accept rather than judge what makes them different.
