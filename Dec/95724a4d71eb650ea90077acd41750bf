 So, what are the steps to take to ensure you have a smooth border crossing? • Remember that South African passport-holders residing in the country do not need a visa to travel to Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and eSwatini. • South African driver’s licences are valid Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and eSwatini. • Obtain an international driver’s permit to make exploring on your own when visiting foreign shores easier. • South African travellers must obtain a ZA sticker to be stuck on the vehicle in which they are travelling. These can be purchased from AA accredited sales agent stores such as Safari Centre.

This has two small white rectangular strips on the right- and left-hand side of the front bumper and two small red square strips on the right- and left-hand side of the rear bumper. This is required by law. If you are towing a trailer, two small red strips on the right- and left-hand side of the trailer’s rear bumper are compulsory, too. • In Mozambique, motorists towing a trailer are required to affix a set of two yellow and blue warning triangle stickers to the front bumper and one on the rear of the trailer. • If your travels take you through Zimbabwe, you are required to obtain a police clearance certificate for vehicles and trailers. This applies to travellers using the Chirundu Border Post. • Rentals and 4×4 vehicles travelling across borders need to be accompanied by a letter of authority from the rental company granting permission for the vehicle to be driven cross border. No police clearance certificate is necessary for this. ALSO READ: How to entertain your family in a healthier way
