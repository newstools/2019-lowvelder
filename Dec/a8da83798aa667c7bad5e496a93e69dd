 A patient of Sabie Hospital has been waiting for a hip replacement in this hospital for 67 days.
Dietlof Ziegfried Vermaak (65) recently fell and broke his hip. He was admitted to the hospital for assistance, but his family have raised concerns about the treatment he has been receiving. According to Pierre Nothnagel, his son-in-law, Vermaak needs a hip replacement. This needs to be done in Themba Hospital, but for 64 days Vermaak has been lying in pain, with neither of the hospitals communicating with him.

The spokesman for the provincial Department of Health, Dumisani Malamule, did not address Vermaak’s specific case when the newspaper asked him about it. He only explained that a hip replacement is a specialised operation that cannot be performed at Sabie, which is a district hospital.

He could not say how long Vermaak will still have to wait for the operation.
