 KABOKWENI – According to a statement issued by Brig Leonard Hlathi, the constable purportedly went to Pienaar to visit his girlfriend, Goodness Mhaule (34), and found her with another man, identified as Sibusiso Justice Khoza (31). Hlathi stated that reports suggests that the police officer drew his service firearm after an argument ensued between him and Khoza, whom he shot and lethally wounded. “The enraged constable then went on a shooting rampage, fatally shooting Mhaule as she was running towards her parents’ house for assistance. He also shot at her brother, who was trying to intervene during the squabble,” Hlathi said. The SAPS and medical personnel were summoned to the scene where both Mhaule and Khoza were certified dead on the scene. “The police constable was swiftly arrested, while Mhaule’s brother, who sustained non-critical injuries during the shooting, was taken to hospital for medical treatment and observation,” Hlathi explained.
