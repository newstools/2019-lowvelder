 MBOMBELA – CANSA, in partnership with Melusomuhle Foundation, held a very special Christmas party recently. The day was attended by members of CANSA Lowveld, members from the Melusomuhle Foundation, children from CANSA’s Tough Living with Cancer (TLC) programme and Melusomuhle Foundation and also supportive community members. Due to the rain, the function was moved to the upper level parking at Sonpark, but this did not deter the children from having a ball. Easigrass sponsored a photo corner, with some animal sculptures, a face-painter and a clown keeping the children entertained. There was also a pamper station for the moms where they could get a foot massage and be spoiled like they deserve. “We’d like to thank everyone who made the party possible, especially our sponsors,” said Ramphosi Shawe, CANSA social worker. CANSA TLC is a children’s support programme for those affected by cancer.

It is a physically, financially and extremely emotionally draining journey for both the children and parents or guardians, thus we wanted to take some time to celebrate life and with the patients, siblings and parents, and what a better way than to get together for a Christmas party,” Mandisa Mthembu, divisional coordinator for service delivery, CANSA Mpumalanga, said. “Most of these patients stay at our children’s care home, CANSA Nicus Lodge in Pretoria while they receive their treatment, but we want to ensure continuity of support even when they are back home in the outskirts of the Lowveld, making available our support services and social workers.” ALSO READ: CANSA Lowveld undertakes Shades of Pink Walk
