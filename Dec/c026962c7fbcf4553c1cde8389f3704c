 The elderly man, Henry Brown, who was attacked in his house on the Uitkyk Road several weeks ago, passed away early this morning.
Brown, his wife, Martie, and son, Tommy, were attacked at their home on November 3.
The incident occurred at approximately 02:00 after a small gang of men gained entry to their house through a window. All three victims sustained serious head injuries during the attack. Tommy managed to fight back and one of the attackers was shot in self-defence. The attacker died.
The arrest followed after information was received from an informant with regard to the whereabouts of the suspect.
A second suspect was apprehended shortly after. Martie and Tommy were both hospitalised after the attack, but has since been discharged. Henry sustained critical head injuries and was fighting for his life in ICU.
