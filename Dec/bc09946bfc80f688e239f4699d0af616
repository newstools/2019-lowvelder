 This is where a little bit of advanced planning can go a very long way; an arsenal of activities to keep the little ones out of mischief, so to speak. The promise of cookies alone will be enough to get your kids interested in baking, but the process can be even more fun. Get kids of any age involved. Use food colouring and cookie cutters to make fun cookie designs. Once the cookies are out of the oven and cooled, allow your kids to decorate them with icing, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, mini marshmallows or any other fun ingredients you might have on hand.

And it’s ready! You don’t have to go far to have a picnic. Your own garden will be perfect. Pack a basket with snacks, spread a blanket on the grass, organise some games – it will be an afternoon to remember. Make a treasure map with clues to find some treasure you have hidden somewhere in the garden. It doesn’t have to be expensive or big — any little treat will be exciting when it is found outdoors. Go on nature walks with a purpose. On the beach, collect shells and stones to later make a shell castle or shell and stone sculptures. In the forest, get kids to seek out different sorts of bugs, plants or trees. Alternatively, give them a map to plot the route you are taking. Giving them control and a plan will ensure they don’t get bored too quickly. Plan some play dates and invite friends over. While they spend time with their friends it may give you the opportunity to get some work done and perhaps even connect with other parents. Plus the invite may be returned one day. Give your child a small plant to care for. Maybe they can grow a herb garden or a few flowers on the windowsill. Have them water their plant each day and when you need a few moments, ask them to check on it. They’ll be immersed in their work. It is the perfect indoor activity for when it’s raining, too hot or too cold. Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup salt
4 teaspoons cream of tartar
2 cups lukewarm water
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (coconut oil works too)
Food colouring
Small plastic bags Stir the flour, salt and cream of tartar in a large pot. Next add the water and oil. If you’re only making one colour, add in the colour now as well. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Continue stirring until the dough has thickened and begins to form into a ball. Remove from heat and then place inside a gallon-sized bag or onto wax paper. Allow to cool slightly and then knead until smooth. If you’re adding colours after, divide the dough into balls (for how many colours you want) and then add the dough into the bags. Start with about 5 drops of colour and add more to brighten it. Knead the dough while inside the bag so it doesn’t stain your hands. Once it’s all mixed together, you’re ready to play.
