 The local Vodacom team stood in solidarity with survivors of gender-based violence in a silent march on Friday. It started at their offices in Jones Street. They marched holding posters with messages such as “Together we can end this”, “Protect us” and “No means no”. Their aim is to be part of the movement championing the fight against gender-based violence and to shine the light to prevent more people from falling victim to this scourge. Loreal Charnley, from Vodacom, said they decided to do the walk during the 16 Days of Activism, which ends tomorrow.

As a company, we want to stand together and bring awareness of our current gender-based violence toll-free number. “The call centre is free and it links the survivors of abuse with social workers who can give them the help and support they need to get out of the situation.” ALSO READ: Santa pays a visit to Penryn preschoolers During the march, they handed out MyMeMeZa, a handheld alarm. “It can be kept safe with you in your handbag.
