 MALALANE – The incident took place at the Malelane Technical Services living quarters at around 20:00. According to the park’s communications head, Ike Phaahla, the boy was 30 months old. He was rushed to hospital by family members and certified dead by doctors at Shongwe Hospital. The section ranger, his lance-corporal and the regional ranger found and shot dead the animal “to remove the danger of another person falling victim.” ALSO SEE: Four caught red-handed with rhino horn in KNP “In parks like the KNP predators do interact with tourists and staff and at times it may result in species like leopard getting habituated to people and losing their fear,” Phaahla said in the statement. “The change in natural behaviour can then lead to unfortunate incidents such as this. This is an unfortunate risk that staff experience when having to live and work in environments like the KNP. These events are very rare occurrences but always tragic when they do occur.” The name of the little boy is being withheld until all family members have been notified.
