 It was a remarkable day when Canary Walk Mall, for the first time, brought a man-sized slingshot to the Mosaïek Stropieland golf day on Thursday. The event was held at Mbombela Golf Club. The main sponsor for the day was Skycastle Investments. The theme was “back to school” and the golf course was decorated appropriately.
