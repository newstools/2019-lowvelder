 MBOMBELA –  The initiative formed part of AfriForum’s Anchor Town Roadshow (ATR), which was launched in February this year. Amo du Preez, chairman of the Youth Portfolio of AfriForum’s Nelspruit branch, said the ATR is a campaign to create hope in various towns in the country. For this month, the focus is on Mbombela.

Mbombela Air-Conditioning, Jaco’s Jumping Castles, Nelspruit Voortrekkers as well as White River AfriForum assisted. Outside the ATR, AfriForum Youth has a standing relationship with the learning centre, an educational facility which is equipped to cater for learners with special needs. As the school is a non-profit organisation, it relies heavily on support and donations from the community. There are currently 130 learners. We started to assist them in February,” Du Preez said. “We come here once a month with sponsors and community members to perform small maintenance and restoration work. During our next visit we will be working on creating rain drainage systems, as every time it rains, the water goes directly into the Wendy houses.” Yulandi Jansma, Pro Gratia marketing manager, appreciated the gesture. We are thankful for the help they have been offering us for the past five months and we are looking forward for their help in the next couple of months. We encourage other stakeholders to join the great work that AfriForum are doing,” she said. In July, the ATR will visit Tzaneen in Limpopo. To get involved, contact Du Preez on 063-757-3063.
