 The Department of Human Settlements has issued a statement condemning individuals and businesses that are allegedly rehabilitating houses without the government’s approval. Around 2130 houses in Tekwane and areas surrounding the City of Mbombela were affected by last year’s storm. According to the spokesperson of the department, Freddy Ngobe, sub-contractors through the local councillor requested a meeting with the department to present the matter and discuss possible solutions. ”It is claimed that there are about 150 houses that have since been fixed or currently being attended to by un-contracted individuals or business people. An urgent meeting between the department and some concerned sub-contractors revealed that such illegal activities are taking place,” he said.
