 BARBERTON – The provincial Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport (DPWRT) has finally started removing it. The cables have been reported to pose a danger to motorists and at some places have fallen down to the road due to their deterioration. They used to support a mining conveyor belt from Swaziland to Barberton, but it is no longer in use.

Sappi cannot state with complete certainty to whom the cableway that runs between Barberton and Swaziland belongs. “Historically, it existed to convey mining material between the two points, and as such, has always spanned a certain portion of Sappi’s land, particularly our Twello plantation.” According to Schwalbach, the area underneath the cableway is kept clear with an unplanted servitude the same way they treat Eskom power lines which traverse their property. This is a safety requirement to keep forestry activities beneath and near the cableway to a minimum. Over the years, Sappi has expressed concerns about the state of the cableway, which has shown major signs of deterioration due to wear, tear and exposure to weather conditions and lack of maintenance,” added Schwalbach.
