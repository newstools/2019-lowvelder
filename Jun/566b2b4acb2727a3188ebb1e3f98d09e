 MBOMBELA – The community has banded together since the fire on the night of November 15, that is believed to have started in the laundry room. Luckily Betty Mandlazi managed to get all the inhabitants out unscathed. She was briefly hospitalised due to the shock of the loss of almost everything they owned, including beds, clothing and the entire kitchen.

The roof was also severely damaged, which left the house uninhabitable. They have been living in tents, but that changed this week when the roof was finally replaced.  Again, the community banded together to provide the needed help.  Guy Bagnall says he has been working with Mandlazi for decades, and while it took some time, the roof was an important step in getting the house back to normal.  There will course be ongoing work done once the roof is on. For one thing, the house still does not have electricity or plumbing, ceilings, tiling or cupboards. The orphanage has received such an abundance of donations, but some items they cannot use. These include double-bed mattresses, which do not fit into the dormitories, and children’s clothing that is not of the right size for the kids in Mandlazi’s care. These can be collected in exchange for cash donations, which will be used to care for the children.
