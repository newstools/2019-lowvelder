His biggest tip for creating a successful economy was to create more job opportunities. “The minute you create jobs, SARS can collect money and that is where the money will come from to better the country,” Botha explained.  He added that by implementing the correct policies to spend this money, the economy will grow, “and we can already see that under the leadership of president Cyril Ramaphosa these policy changes are taking place. But we need at least 18 months to turn it around completely.”  Botha said that he had been in touch with Ramaphosa about these changes, as well as various other elements that will impact the economy, for example land expropriation without compensation. “If we do not do this in the right way, it will lead to a recession.” ALSO READ: KLCBT presents future ideas and achievements at AGM  Much to the delight of most of the audience, Botha stated that tourism is the country’s only long-term investment. He predicted that South Africa will have three per cent real growth next year and that the money will be implemented in the right way – according to policies which are aligned with the Constitution.  “We are not as poor as we think we are. This economy is not dead and there is no recession in sight,” Botha said, and urged residents to be positive.
