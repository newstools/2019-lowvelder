Set in a beautiful secure estate with stunning views of the Royal Mdzimba Mountains, the gold and browns of the African savannah are echoed throughout the Villas with each room designed to make the most of the African sunlight and views.  The signature Lihawu restaurant provides a fine dining experience, with exquisite pan-African cuisine. Furnished in elegant African style, the warmth and gentle lighting are greatly conducive to ordering something special from Sivunu, our premier wine cellar.  Guests have a choice of lounges and outdoor venues in which to relax and soak up the best of Africa. Whether you prefer the welcoming pool terrace or the more formal lounge, you may be forgiven for being reluctant to ever leave this haven of elegance.  Located just 10 minutes from the capital, Mbabane, the Villas are well positioned close to a range of attractions and activities.
