 This year the Lowveld Chamber Music Association (LCMA) and Innibos are teaming up to bring a full-length opera to the festival for the first time. Music lovers can expect an exceptional production. Glen Seven Allen In the two leading roles are Glenn Seven Allen and Celeste Morales, both from New York. Glenn is a stalwart of the New York scene and has sung the role of Rodolfo many times, while Celeste, singing the role of Mimi, is a fresh face with a glorious voice. The rest of the cast is sourced from Cape Town and Pretoria, and are all experienced vocalists in their own right. In the role of the jealous lover, Marcello, is Solly Motaung, and the apple of his eye, Musetta, is sung by Busi Ngejane. Celeste Morales Rodolfo’s friends, Colline and Schaunard are sung by Conroy Scott and Luvuyo Mbundu and the cast is rounded out by Pretoria-based Johan Scheepers who sings Alcindoro. The local Sempre Vino chorus will add a touch of colour to the second act café scene. This production will be accompanied on piano, with the talented Portuguese pianist, Jose Dias, conducting. Solly Motaung The look and feel is also amped up. La Bohème will not only be magnificent on the ear, but also on the eye. Supertitles will be provided, so you can easily follow the entire story in English. Jose Dias Puccini’s La Bohème makes its debut at 18:00 on Saturday June 29 and shows again at 12:00 on Sunday, June 30 at the Mbombela Civic Centre. Magdalene Minnaar
