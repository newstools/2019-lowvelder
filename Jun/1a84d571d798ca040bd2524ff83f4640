 This was a bit special, though. We came rolling into the parking lot in bakkies and trailers, loaded with bikes and then some. The pits were set up a few hundred metres from the hotel, but on Friday night the parking lot of the hotel looked like one too. Our course designer was none other than Jamie Watt. He is as passionate about enduro riding as he is about preparing food at his restaurant and thus everything was top notch.  Somehow Jamie found an extra 10km to incorporate into the existing track. Luckily this was reserved for the more experienced riders only. ALSO READ: An enduro race for the whole family Jamie, never one to do things in half measure, worked in a few extra challenging obstacles to test competitors’ skill levels. This comprised of tech, speed, climbs with loose rocks, riverbeds and short stretches where riders can just let rip.  The start of the race presented a few hairy moments with two bikes sliding off the bridge and a third being held back by the railings.  Thank goodness these rides could recover their bikes and carry on with riding. One rider even finished first in his class after falling from the bridge. My day almost turned into a nightmare when I discovered I had lost my phone. Luckily I found it next to the track. I lost some considerable time searching for it and could not keep up with the leaders.  But hey, that’s how the cookie crumbles. The next race will be the KMIA Enduro scheduled for August 24. Hope to see all you hooligans there! ALSO READ: Last Imperial Nelspruit Toyota Hazyview Enduro shows moxie
