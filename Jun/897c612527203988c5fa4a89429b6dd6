 MBOMBELA – First-year student, Similo Siyenga believes that the circumstances in which you grow up should not dictate what you can and cannot achieve. Raised in Matsulu, Siyenga is living proof of this and now studies civil engineering at the University of Pretoria. Yet he received some help getting there and now wishes to give back and help others. “When I was at school at Hoërskool Rob Ferreira I found that I struggled with maths and physical science in the first term of my matric year. For additional help, I visited a school in Matsulu where high school teachers donated their time after school to help students.” Similo Siyenga while he was still at school.
