As a career advisor at Unigrad College, the biggest part of my job is engaging with future students and answering questions. It’s alarming to see how many school leavers seem to be embarrassed by the fact they that they are not sure what career path to choose once they have completed Matric. The importance of asking the right questions and choosing a tertiary institute that will suit your education needs is vital to your future career success. This is why attending our Unigrad College open day will benefit you immensely. You will be exposed to various aspects of campus life, and get the opportunity to speak with staff from all academic programmes and student services, as well as senior students who can provide valuable insight into what it takes to pursue particular study routes.  At Unigrad College our mission is a constant focus on face to face teaching where we provide each student with the motivation they will need to achieve their potential. With over 100 years of combined experience, the vast experience of Unigrad’s lecturing team, both in academic and business arenas ensures that lecturers bring passion, commitment to excellence and practical know-how to the classroom. Our accredited national qualifications and professional endorsements are relevant to the job market.  Many of the courses involve practicals whereby students are exposed to the industry in their field of study, adding a hands-on dimension which makes the Unigrad College graduate extremely marketable. Final year students participate in our job readiness workshops. With 2020 full-time registrations already open, it’s not too early to be planning next year’s studies.  Join us on Saturday the 8th of June between 08:30 and 11:30 to find out why Unigrad College has won Best Tertiary Institute in Mbombela for five years.
