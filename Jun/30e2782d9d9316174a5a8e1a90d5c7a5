What makes Paindane unique is the reef, which protrudes north approximately 800 metres parallel to the beach, forming a natural bay protected from ocean currents and waves. This bay is ideal for launching boats as well as bathing. During low tide, the inside of the reef forms a natural swimming pool ideal for snorkelling. Paindane reef is home to a coral garden and a variety of soft and hard coral boasting an array of colours and an abundance of reef fish. The natural bay is an ideal playground for all water sport enthusiasts.  Paindane is paradise for deep sea anglers with unrivalled catches of gamefish and billfish with the ideal fishing area only 300 metres from the launching site. Pinnacles with shoals of monster kings, cuta, tuna and all the other Pelagic species are waiting for you. Jet ski, Hobie Cat, paddle ski and boardsailing enthusiasts enjoy the safe launch at Paindane and the fact that you sail directly into the backline and deep waters of the Mozambique Channel, without any surf to contend with.  With many world-renowned reefs within easy distance, Paindane rates as one of the best dive spots on the African east coast. The famous Manta Reef is close by, with excellent visibility and virtually hundreds of mantas that have made this reef their home. For those who are not into water activities, long walks along the pristine, sun-bleached beaches, swimming in the warm tropical waters, tanning in the basking sun, or sipping an ice cold beer in one of the beach bars can all be enjoyed.
