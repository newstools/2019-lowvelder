 MBOMBELA – An intimate event driven by women for women. This is the initiative behind the regular “Let’s Do Coffee” events of the South African Council for Businesswomen (SACBW) Nelspruit. One of these was held at Tindlovu restaurant at the Lowveld National Botanical Garden on Friday.  “The vision behind these events is that they should be small and intimate so that the women can have the opportunity to network with one another,” organiser Odette Hartzenberg explained.

The morning started out with every woman introducing herself and her business. One of the branch’s leaders, Ant Fourie also gave every woman a piece of candy. These sweets symbolised their childlike innocence. “In the middle of the year we sometimes lose steam. It is good to do things to find your inner child,” Fourie explained.
