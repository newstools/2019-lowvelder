 Spectacular craft pieces from all over the country were exhibited at the Innibos National Craft Awards held at the Mbombela Civic Centre on Sunday evening. This is the third event of its kind. This year 1 200 entries were received. “These pieces are the threads and fibre of art in South Africa,” said Innibos’ marketing manager, Sandra Jacobs. “This competition is the only one of its kind in the country where craft excellence and skill is celebrated.”  This year, the first prize of R50 000 was split between two winners. The first joint winner was the team of Noria Mahlaule and Try Nkuna, from the Kaross collective, whose traditional embroidery impressed the judges. “We are very proud to be a part of Kaross and to represent here tonight,” they said.
The second joint winner was Clare Rothwell, who made a chair out of recycled newspaper and eco bricks. “When I was a little girl I used to sit in a chair like this one and read a lot. The chair was inspired by this and my passion for recycling,” Rothwell said.
