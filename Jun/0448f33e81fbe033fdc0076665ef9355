 The research, in partnership with Glasgow University, has created a “sensory steering wheel”, parts of which can be quickly heated and cooled to inform drivers where to turn, when to change lane or to warn of an approaching junction. This could be particularly useful when visibility is reduced through poor weather or the layout of the road.
The technology has also been applied to the gear-shift paddles to indicate when handing over from the driver to autonomous control in future self-driving vehicles is complete. Driver distraction is a major contributor to road accidents around the world and accounts for 10 per cent of all fatal crashes in the USA. Jaguar Land Rover’s research suggests thermal cues could be a way to keep drivers fully focused on the road.

For comfort a driver could adjust the range of temperature change. Studies have shown temperature-based instructions could also be used for non-urgent notifications, where vibrations could be deemed unnecessarily attention grabbing, for example as a warning when fuel is running low, or for upcoming events, such as points of interest. Thermal cues can also be used where audio feedback would be deemed too disruptive to cabin conversations or media playback. Alexandros Mouzakitis, Jaguar Land Rover Electrical Research senior manager, said, “Safety is a number one priority for Jaguar Land Rover and we are committed to continuously improving our vehicles with the latest technological developments. “The sensory steering wheel is all part of this vision, with thermal cues able to reduce the amount of time drivers have to take their eyes off the road. Research has shown people readily understand the heating and cooling dynamics to denote directions and the subtlety of temperature change can be perfect for certain feedback.” Jaguar and Land Rover models already boast a wide range of sophisticated advanced driver assistance systems designed to improve driver and vehicle safety, including the new generation Head-Up Display in the Range Rover Velar. The Velar also features capacitive steering wheel controls for common functions that combine with the interactive driver display to help reduce driver distraction.
