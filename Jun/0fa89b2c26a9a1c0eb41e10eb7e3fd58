 MBOMBELA – Barbara Harrison’s eyes welled up with tears of joy as she said, “The tumour has shrunk by more than 80 per cent.” This is with reference to her three-year-old son Kuen’s neuroblastoma that was discovered less than six months ago. The cancerous tumour is in Kuen’s chest behind his heart, while another, that had been wrapped around his spinal chord, was removed earlier this year. The Harrison family: (front) Kuen, Connor, (back) Simon and Barbara. According to Brenda, through chemo- therapy the tumour behind his heart has shrunk from 10,6 by 4,7 centimetres, to 2,6 by 1,7 centimetres. However, Kuen had to spend a week in isolation last week due to illness.

He had a cold, but out of fear that it would develop into something worse, the doctors decided to keep him in isolation,” Brenda explained. She added that Kuen’s doctors feel that the risk of operating is far greater than that of completing the course of treatment and then re-evaluating the situation. “He has two sessions left in the cycle and we will see what the situation is from there. We have learned that things change every single day, but I am really hoping my boy does not have to go through this again.”  Brenda said Kuen gets very emotional when he sees a hospital. “I tell him that I am very proud of him and that he is very brave. It is hard for a parent to watch your child go through this and it is even more difficult to understand why children who are so small have to go through this.” ALSO READ: Langasem neem elke tree om siekes te help
