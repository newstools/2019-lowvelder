 According to the Consumer Protection Act number 68 of 2008, all businesses operating within the automotive and related industries, such as manufacturers, dealers, component suppliers, service providers and panel beaters, are compelled by law to register with the MIOSA. Van Vreden explained, “All the responsible players in the industry have registered with the MIOSA in the interest of customer satisfaction and protection against customer exploitation. “Would you take your sick child to an unqualified medical practitioner?” he asked. “Therefore, if your vehicle needs a repair, ensure that the service provider is qualified and registered with the MIOSA. “By dealing with a service provider which is not registered, you are dealing with individuals who are operating their trade with little regard for the consumer. “It also becomes extremely difficult for the MIOSA to assist consumers where non-compliant service providers are involved,” warned Van Vreden. The same is applicable when it comes to motorcycle, motorboat and lawnmower dealers and service providers.
