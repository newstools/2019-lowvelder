 This annual event hosted by Church Unlimited at its premises on Friday night, showcased more than 30 stalls with food from all around the world. Each station offered food from a different country. Each small dish, priced between R5 and R35, was there to titillate your taste buds. The teams manning the stations also dressed up according to the theme.
