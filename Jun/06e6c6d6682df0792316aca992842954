The interchange will improve traffic flow onto and off the N4 Toll Route and enhance safety, as it will eliminate the need for pointsmen who currently manage the morning and afternoon traffic,” said Soares-Nicholson.  Raubex Construction has been appointed as the project’s main contractor. Soares-Nicholson said roadworks will spread over four kilometres and the project is expected to take just over two years to complete.

According to TRAC chief executive officer, Graham Esterhuysen, the project is in line with the company’s commitment to communities along the N4 Toll Route. He said apart from improved traffic flow, local communities will further benefit from the initiative through job creation. “Local contractors will be appointed to assist the main contractor. The process is already in motion, with the contractor following SANRAL’s 14-point plan for road construction projects,” explained Esterhuysen. This plan focuses on improved liaison with local communities and structures which in turn ensures inclusivity in the allocation of project-related work to locals
