Thicker curtains – replace thin curtains with heavier wool or fleece drapes in the winter.   2. Socialise – invite your friends or family over. All their body heat will heat up the place. 3. Layer up your bed covers from the thickest in the inside and the thinnest on the outside. Thin, dense blankets should be on top to prevent convective heat loss.    4. Cooking and baking can keep the house warm – the stove and oven heats up the house. 5. Block the cold with pool noodles – keep heat in and cold out by cutting a pool noodle in half lengthwise, wrapping it in fabric, and sliding it under your door.    6. Layer up – wear warm clothes, get a warmer jacket, wear a hat, gloves and scarf.
