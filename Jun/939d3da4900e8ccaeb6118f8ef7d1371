As a prelude to the action of the Panorama Cycle Tour, the Barnyard at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre also hosted The Parlotones on Friday and Saturday night. Although it was one of the first real winter evenings in the Lowveld, patrons flocked to the theatre to listen to the sounds of Kahn Morbee, Neil Pauw and brothers Glen and Paul Hodgson. Known for their hard work on and off stage, the group once again didnâ€™t disappoint with their passionate performance, which resembled their dedication and commitment to their music.
