 The Nelspruit SPCA is still low on food due to the fact that there are fewer adoptions. According to the organisation’s vice-chairman, Ludi Botha, their overall food supply is now at a very low 17 per cent.  The SPCA is the only animal welfare organisation governed by law, according to the SPCA Act No 169 of 1993.  They believe that every living creature has intrinsic value and is a sentient being.

The SPCA recognises that animals are in the service of humans, but that it does not give people the right to exploit them or treat them inhumanely.  “We as the management team and staff are committed to fulfilling our role and mission with compassion, dedication, diligence and perseverance, and will not allow any animal to suffer.” To adopt a pet or to donate to the shelter, visit them at 6 Meidlinger Street or call them on 013-753-3582.
