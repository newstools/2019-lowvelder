 Paint & Wine is a fun night out where people paint and enjoy a drink while doing it.The sold-out event, which took place at Adega Nelspruit, was held last Thursday.    All those attending relaxed and enjoyed themselves. According to the organiser, Sheralyn Janse van Rensburg, pairing wine and art was an idea that came about because of the love she has for the two.

She added that she has hosted the same events in other provinces. “When I did this for the first time, it was for raising funds for our church. After that I started hosting other events. The turnout is always great and the guests enjoy the idea of pairing wine with art,” she explained.  Anyone who is interested in attending is welcome, even if you do not know how to draw or paint.
“The event is all about having fun and it is open to anyone interested,” Janse van Rensburg added.   The next Paint & Wine events are scheduled for July 3 in White River and July 4 in Mbombela. For more information, contact Janse van Rensburg on
