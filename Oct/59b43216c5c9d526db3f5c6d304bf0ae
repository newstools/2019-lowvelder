 BARBERTON – Two small crocodiles set tongues wagging on social media this weekend after making their escape from a crocodile farm late Friday evening. According to the farm owner, Jan Vermeulen, this is a regular occurrence and the reptiles pose no threat to motorists. “The area has a large number of crocodiles and it is not uncommon for them to escape from time to time. A number of them have taken to the road over the years, with no reported injuries to anyone,” he said. ALSO READ: Another 157 Santa Shoeboxes needed to help less fortunate

Vermeulen suspects that the two may have dug a hole underneath a fence before making their getaway. This could not be confirmed, as he said that the close inspection of the fence did not indicate that any holes were dug. “We checked the fences along the farm and did not see any holes. The only other way would be that they may have climbed over a portion of fencing.” Sakkie Dednam, owner of Hi-Tech Barberton, confirmed that an alert was sent out on Facebook.

“We received the reports and dispatched officers to the scene. They conducted a thorough search of the area and were unable to find the two crocodiles.” Dednam added that he had not received any reports indicating that the the two runaway reptiles were tracked down and returned to the farm.
