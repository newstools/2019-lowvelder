 The choir competed in the macro category for high schools.  What makes the achievement so special is that the learners had to sing in a language that was not their home language. The competition was hosted in Afrikaans. A mother whose child goes to Hoërskool Nelspruit (NHS), Chermone Topham, said that she was there to support NHS, but when Lowveld High School started to sing, they blew the audience away. “The perfect mix of sounds and melodies and music hit you in the face like a brick. It was incredible!” She added that she had tears in her eyes.  Other comments from the audience members included that the school was in a league its own. Lowveld High was the only school that received a standing ovation. Sing in Harmonie is currently the largest school choir competition in South Africa. This is when television coverage, prize packages and the amount of entries are taken into consideration. It offers schools across the country the chance to make their mark on national television and stand the chance to win their share of R50 000 in prizes.
