 The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) recently issued a press release advising their beneficiaries about choosing a new payment option. “A beneficiary who is not happy about the option he or she selected initially during the phasing out of CPS to South African Post Office can visit any SASSA office to change the payment option,” Kenneth Ndlangamandla said. Should a beneficiary decide to change a payment option, they must visit their nearest SASSA office immediately and remember to bring their identity document as well as proof of residence. Anyone who wishes to change to a bank of their own choice must include a bank statement or confirmation letter of the bank account. Beneficiaries should also note that the change of payment option occurs immediately, unless the changes were submitted after the cutoff date (e.g.the beneficiary submitted the documents of changing a payment option after the 15th day of the month, the changes of payment option will be affected at the end of the following month).
