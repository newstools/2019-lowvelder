Bettie Pretorius, who was one of the day’s organisers, said, “The whole idea behind bringing women together at a coffee date is to encourage them to network and market their businesses, while learning what their counterparts in the business world have to offer. “Tony Wake’s talk revolved around being more confident when engaging in public speaking, which he said was the second worst thing most people feared after death.” Local artist, Natascha C, was also in attendance and opined, “This is the ideal platform for Lowveld women to connect and network and share their talents. It also affords us the opportunity to enjoy a cup of coffee together on a Friday morning.” Roelene Els. ALSO READ: BREAKING NEWS: Mark Norris and his mother found shot dead on Low’s Creek farm

Candidate attorney, Isaura Cardoso, added that the setting allowed the women to relax as they made strategic business connections. Mariolise le Roux, who has garnered a solid reputation as an event organiser of note in the Lowveld, said, “This allows women to support one another’s businesses and to empower one another.” Renowned local make-up artist, Cecilia Kaufman, said women meeting in this manner gave all women in business greater power.
