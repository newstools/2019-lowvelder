 Two separate bakkie crashes claimed six lives in the last 24 hours in Mpumalanga.

Three people were killed instantly, one person was critically injured and two people sustained light injuries. The driver is among those who were injured. In another incident, three people died last night around 19:30 when a driver of a bakkie lost control and overturned on the N4 between Mbombela and Schagen towards the Sudwala Caves. Eight people were moderately injured, while another person was seriously injured. The deceased included the driver. The injured in both accidents were rushed to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela.
