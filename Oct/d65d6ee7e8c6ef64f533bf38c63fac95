Rose will share how she, from a young age, always behaved in ways that would bring her acceptance and approval. Orr is described as priding herself on being a good girl. At age 14, she was drawn to Jesus having heard about the love of God, and then immediately set about trying to be good enough to deserve His love. Witter is also a speaker, teacher, and the author of numerous Bible studies and books that focus on Jesus and His finished work.
