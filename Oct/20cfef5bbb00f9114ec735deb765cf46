 This happens in Nelspruit all the time; in the past two weeks I saw with my own eyes how an ambulance driver desperately sits behind a stubborn motorist who refuses to make way. Why do these people feel it is okay to ignore the blazing red lights and wailing sirens? So  you can get to your meeting on time? While you were probably the difference between life and death for some hapless patient somewhere? South African road regulations actually state it is illegal to not make way for emergency vehicles. The minute you see an emergency vehicle approaching you must make way by either  pulling over to the right or stopping to the right of the road. On a high-speed roadway, you should slow down and move to the right, as should all drivers upon seeing the lights and hearing the siren. Lowveld drivers have gained some notoriety for not always showing courtesy and respect to emergency vehicles. This is a situation that challenges operators of emergency equipment on a daily basis,” Do not stop abruptly or move out of the way recklessly, endangering yourself or other road users. “Additionally, wait until you see where the emergency vehicle is coming from before making your decision about where to move. Rather carefully assess the situation before making an impulsive move.” There are a number of other tips to keep in mind. “If there is space in the yellow lane, don’t move into this as it’s meant for emergency vehicles. Even if others block this lane, rather move to the right. Never skip a red light or stop sign to make way either. Don’t immediately move back into your position in case another emergency vehicle is following behind.” Among the list of “do not”s are: never race to beat an emergency vehicle to a green light, never drive through a red light or stop sign, never disregard the emergency lights and siren, and never play your music so loudly you can’t hear a siren.
