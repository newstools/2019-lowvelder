 The royal couple, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, visited South Africa last week. The duchess wore the leaf-inspired earrings, made from porcelain and 18-carat gold lustre and sterling silver during a visit to the British Commissioner’s home.  Bosch said she was absolutely overwhelmed when she saw the photos of the duchess wearing the pair of earrings, as she had no idea. “I think someone must have given them to her as a gift. I feel so honoured that she wore my jewellery.” Born and raised in a well-known family of ceramic artists, Bosch creates fine, porcelain jewellery that is hand-painted with 18-carat gold lustre and fired to 740 degrees Celsius. Thereafter the pieces are assembled with sterling silver.  Her creations are made from porcelain, incorporating a variety of different materials such as glazes, pigments, gold and silver. “Every piece is handmade with care, given special attention to detail while embracing natural imperfections of the hand at work.” ALSO READ: Joubert en Seuns move in different crop direction The black and gold earrings that Meghan wore are part of Bosch’s floral series. “I found inspiration in flowers and leaves, and that was also the first range where I started adding more texture to the earrings.” Bosch, originally from White River, now resides with her boyfriend in Wilderness. “It is different living by the ocean. The mist and wind takes some getting used to. I now work from home, where I have set up a studio.” ALSO READ: The Marriage Course will set you on course for a strong rejuvenation of your marriage When asked if she would return to the Lowveld soon, she replied that the Lowveld always stays in your blood, and that she doesn’t know right now what the future holds, but that she will probably not stay away for too long.
