 After yesterday’s extreme heat the lions enjoyed the course so much that they decided to spend the night. It seems like this pride definitely hit the hole in one with these greener pastures. It is still unknown why they decided to make this their new home. It could have been due to them being too lazy to go back to the bush or even because they wanted to be spectators to a round or two.

Only in South Africa can you play a round of golf and have a pride of lions cheering you on. If you do decide to go play a round or two today rather use the golf cart or wear your running shoes, just in case. Watch as the lions take to the golf course. This day had everything a day in the life of a pride of lion should have; some drinking, some playing games, some affection and a big old standoff with a pack of hyena before chilling down and getting some rest.
