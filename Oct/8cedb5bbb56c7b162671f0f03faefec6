 A young aspiring artist’s work will soon be seen around the country – on the “It’s Not Made in China” water bottles.
Amber Daniel (16) never imagined that her “Man versus Nature” drawing would be selected to be displayed on the well-known water bottle brand. Her teacher submitted the drawing to It’s Not Made in China. The art teacher, Michele Booysen, said she submits her students’ artwork to various competitions on a weekly basis. Amber said her aim was to show how people are destroying their world. ALSO READ: GALLERY: Dewan Craven’s first solo art exhibition “If you look into the glasses it is a city burning down. We as humans always see nature burning down, and now this is a gorilla watching us burning our own things,” she said. She was inspired to do this drawing because of global warming. “Global warming is a real problem. In our school we are doing things to help with global warming, to stop it. This just shows that global warming can cause so much damage,” she explained. Her original artwork was sold during the Uplands and Penryn derby. ALSO WATCH: Stiaan Reynierse and the band at The Pub “All of our artwork was displayed there, for exposure for our school, and parents could buy it. Someone bought mine and our teacher gave us the money,” she said. Her work has also been displayed at the Mbombela gallery, in a gallery in Johannesburg by Nkosinathi Thomas Ngulube, and it was also featured in Art Times magazine. It’s Not Made in China prints six new labels every three or so months. They save all the illustrations they receive and when it is time to print new labels, they put all the submissions to an informal vote. By getting responses from a range of people, they ensure that the public will want to buy these unique bottles.
