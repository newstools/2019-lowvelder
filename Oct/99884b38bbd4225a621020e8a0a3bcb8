 JOHANNESBURG – Kelvin van Baalen was severely injured in a paragliding accident at the Barberton Paragliding Open in June last year when his parachute hit power lines and caught fire. Leigh said he sustained third degree burns to 84 per cent of his body: electric burns, flame burns and inhalation burns.

During that time, “everything that could go wrong, did,” she added. Her son had to be resuscitated nine times, had multiple organ failures, his lungs collapsed and he suffered major cardiac arrest. While the road to recovery is still long, Kelvin has spent the past three months in the Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital, undergoing occupational and physical therapy.  He still has a number of open wounds. He uses a wheelchair and can cover short distances with a walker. “Emotionally he is strong. He wants to go home. He wants to get on with life. He wants to beat his brother at golf. He wants to paraglide again.”  She added that his recovery will be a lifelong journey – and the medical aid certainly does not pay for everything, which include silicone wound dressings, supplements and creams. The family has launched a fundraising campaign to cover his medical expense. Visit “Paraglider in trouble” at clickndonate.com. ALSO SEE: Lions make themselves at home on Skukuza’s golf course
