Rossouw then went back and got a vehicle to assess the situation better. He mentioned that they were still on the golf course at 21:30 and it is just a standard day on the course in the Kruger.

At the end of the day, the lions knew that the grass was definitely greener on the golf course.  Photo credit: Skukuza’s golf course and Jean Rossouw
