 What has six legs and three eyes? That is the question on a Facebook post from Pro-Life Pet Rescue and Rehabilitation posted on Friday. It was posted with a photo ofÂ  Viana van den Heefer playing with her just-adopted dogs, Danger (brown) and Buzz (Greyhound). Danger was treated on a previous Pro-Life outreach. As a result of his badly infected leg, it had to be amputated. His owner did not want him back and he ended up at Pro-Life Pet Rescue, Rehabilitation and Adoption Agency.

These two are best friends. Viana made a choice to adopt both, so as not to separate them. ALSO READ: UPDATE: Here is the load-shedding schedule for Mbombela
