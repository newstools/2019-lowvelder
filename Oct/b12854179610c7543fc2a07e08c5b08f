I’m in the Lowveld, they call it the “Slowveld”, because everything is slow according to the people of Gauteng and other parts of this country, and no, it’s not because of Nyope. We are in real time, for real. Mpumalanga is the place of the rising sun.” ALSO READ: BREAKING NEWS Protest on old airport road Winnie Mnisi from Pretoria responded excitedly: “My new family, how I love you guys.
