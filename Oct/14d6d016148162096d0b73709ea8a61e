 SuperSport recently published a video of Springbok captain, Siya Kolisi, where he explained that despite coming from humble origins, he still succeeded in life. Growing up very poor in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, he endured terrible nights where sometimes he even had to go to sleep on an empty stomach. Kolisi said that instead of going out to steal, he would rather train for his school team and after that train some more for his club; at the time, African Bombers.

He has encouraged so many South Africans and many have even called him a legend and a national hero. We salute you, Siya Kolisi.  Video credit: SuperSport
