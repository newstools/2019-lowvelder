 Do not wait until November or December. Get organised now, warns Dewald Ranft, chairman of the Motor Industry Workshop Association (MIWA), a proud associate of the Retail Motor Industry Organisation (RMI).    “Believe it or not, December is just around the corner and now is the time to get your pre-holiday vehicle checks done before the last-minute scramble begins.” ALSO READ: Sidewalk CIT shocks Mbombela CBD Ranft said it is our responsibility as motorists to do what we can to avoid accidents on our roads during the festive season.    Servicing your car before a road-trip is one way to do just that. “Every year workshops get flooded in November and December with motorists wanting vehicle checks and needing repairs just days before they plan to leave on holiday. What motorists don’t realise is that should maintenance be needed on their vehicle and spare parts are not in stock, these need to be ordered.    This could take several days, if they are available at all. It is risky leaving things to the last minute and could put a real dampener on holiday plans,” he said.

• Suspension
• Drive lines
• Brakes
• Tyres, including the spare and tools
• Fluid levels
• Wipers and windscreen
• V Belts
• Exhaust. If a problem is identified, the mechanic will be able to advise the vehicle owner and provide a quote for repairs needed. “Rather schedule it in now, so you remember to do it ahead of the holiday time.
