 The three men and one woman are aged between 25 and 41 years old. Their appearance resulted from an incident that took place on 15 October 2019, where a 41-year-old man alleged that he delivered iron bars at Kanyamazane, driving a Toyota Fuso truck.  He further alleged that at about 14:00, as he was driving back from Kanyamazane, a white Volkswagen Golf with two occupants blocked the truck, one of the occupant pointed a firearm instructing him to get off the truck and he complied. He claimed that the suspects drove off with the truck.
