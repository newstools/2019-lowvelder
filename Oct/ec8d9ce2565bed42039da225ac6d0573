 The event was well attended by both club members and members of the public. The first-time drivers, in particular, enjoyed the track. A range of vehicles participated on the day – pipe cars, modified and stock standard vehicles.  The track design was such that it had challenges and scares, but was still safe. The marshals were firm but participant-friendly.
