On Saturday Christie Rose, a professed and recovering Pharisee, spoke about her life. ”Since I was a young child, I always behaved in ways that would bring me acceptance and approval.”   Shannon Orr and Connie Witter also spoke at the conference on Saturday. Sandra McCollom, daughter of Joyce Meyer and author of the book I Tried Until I Almost Died, wrapped up the conference with a strong message: ”Remind yourself that you are with Jesus. If you are with Jesus, you are a patient person. God wants me to remind you today that you are protected,” McCollom said.
