 Trans African Concessions (TRAC) is pleased to announce that the construction of the Karino Interchange in Mbombela, is on track. The R390-million project commenced earlier this year and will see the existing intersection transformed into a grade-separated interchange with on and off-ramps and a bridge. The aim of this particular junction is to separate cross-traffic from through traffic and to ease traffic flow at this very busy intersection. The upgrade will better accommodate the increased traffic volumes over recent years, which this section is somewhat infamous for, especially at the KMIA/Plaston Road/N4 intersection. Furthermore, it will enhance road user safety as the need for pointsmen, who currently manage morning and afternoon traffic in the area, will be eliminated. Roadworks, which are being managed by the main contractor Raubex Construction, span over four kilometres. The project is expected to take just over two years to complete. Traffic deviations will be implemented throughout the initiative, which may result in slower-moving traffic and delays. As is the case with all existing rehabilitation and upgrade projects on the N4 Toll Route, the Karino Interchange initiative conforms to TRACâ€™s commitment to communities along the route. Local communities are benefitting in various ways from this venture, including job creation and skills development. TRAC is excited about this project and urges road users to be patient and cautious during the construction phase and to obey all road construction signage when travelling through the area.
