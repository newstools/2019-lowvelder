 A rare sighting of two white lion cubs was captured on camera today by Thomas Ngobeni, a freelance guide in Kruger National Park. Ngobeni said that he is frequently based at Timbavati Safari Lodge and does his game drives around Manyeleti Game Reserve, Orpen and Satara area.  He said that he had a great sighting day by spotting plenty of elephants, two cheetahs, some buffaloes, a leopard eating his impala and lots of other game.
