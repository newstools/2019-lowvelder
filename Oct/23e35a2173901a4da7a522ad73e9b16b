 The South African Orchid Council’s national show was recently held at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre in White River. The national show is held once every three years and this year included a conference, plant exhibitions and an Orchid 101 workshop with several different plant and gardening aficionados. Among these was the well-known Leon Kluge.  The show was very successful, with over 1 000 visitors throughout the weekend.
