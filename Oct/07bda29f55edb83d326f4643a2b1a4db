 A bit of good news ahead for South African motorists ahead of the busy festive season, is that for fuel prices are set to drop slightly, according to the Automobile Association of South Africa (AA). These comments come on the heels of unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF) which has seen drops across the board in the wake of oil price retreats in October.

This ongoing decline in the average exchange rate has meant that most of its losses have been clawed back, and it will have only a modest impact on the fuel price,” said the AA. The Association said that international oil prices also declined slightly as October wore on. “As a result, we are anticipating November drops of between eight and 18 cents for petrol, 14 cents for diesel, and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin”.

It remains to be seen whether this month’s reductions will continue for the rest of the year,” it concluded.
