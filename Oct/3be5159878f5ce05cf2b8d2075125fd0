 During the past year equestrian eventing has grown from strength to strength in the province. This is all due to the dedication of Leon Smith, Mpumalanga chairperson for this unique sport.  Leon is also the owner of Vula Tours, which he started in 1995. He is very involved in tourism in both the Kruger National Park and at Kaapsehoop. This is where his heart lies. He is very involved with Kaapsehoop Horse Trails, and a few years ago expanded to get a volunteer project going where international youngsters can help with the backing and training of horses and work at the Horse Trails itself.
