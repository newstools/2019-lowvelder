 The long and short of it, is do nothing. One thing is certain – Lowvelders love their animals.  With this love however, comes great urge to rescue animals which are seemingly in need. An example of such, is when a bird falls from its nest. When you spot such small, vulnerable creatures alone on the ground our first instinct might be to pick them up and care for them. However, this isn’t always the best thing to do and can actually reduce their chance of survival. Well-meaning people might think they are rescuing a baby bird by picking it up, but most of the time it is better to leave it alone.
