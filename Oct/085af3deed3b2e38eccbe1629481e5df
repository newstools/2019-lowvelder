 Plasma can be isolated and concentrated into various essential medical products used to treat medical conditions such as haemophilia, severe burns, genetic lung disease, primary immunodeficiency disorder, trauma and shock. Donating plasma is different from donating blood. The plasma collection system separates the plasma from red blood platelets, and the red blood platelets will then be returned to the donor, all using one needle.

These blood types are universal and can be used to develop medicine for all other types of blood.
Donors must also be between the ages of 18 and 55, have an HB (haemoglobin) level of between 12,5 and 16, and weigh at least 55 kilograms.  By the end of March 2020, the SANBS aims to supply 20 000 litres of plasma to the National Bioproducts Institute and hopes to increase the the volume in years to come. This new product resonates with the vision and purpose of the SANBS.
If you would like to donate plasma, make sure you have time. Plasma donation can take up to an hour. Dhlamini invites all to come and donate blood and plasma, if you meet the criteria, at the SANBS’ i’langa Mall branch.
