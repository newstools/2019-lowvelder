 MBOMBELA – Rubicon Retirement Village is going green to celebrate the completion of the new phases added to the retirement home. To celebrate this milestone, the residents are planning to plant 50 trees around the complex. The first was planted in a tree-planting ceremony held on Wednesday. The home’s general manager, Driekie Heiberg, said they planted a wild plum tree, one of the largest tree species indigenous to South Africa, to launch the occasion.

“The evergreen tree is used in city parks and as street trees, and will provide enough shade to give residents respite from the Lowveld sun.” Heiberg added that there are 170 residents at Rubicon Retirement Village and that they are trying to get the complex to go green. “We envision planting 50 trees through this project by the end of November.” Jan Lourens, Dave Croxon and Barbara Lourens.

Barbara (85) and Jan Lourens (92) donated and planted the tree. As the couple readied themselves to turn the soil and get it planted, residents gathered outside to witness the event. Once the tree was firmly planted in the soil, the residents raised a glass of champagne to the first of many in a project which hopes to paint the entire complex green and welcome other retirees to a lush, green retirement home.
