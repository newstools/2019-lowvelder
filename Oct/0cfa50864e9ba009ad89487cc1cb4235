They are also working in collaboration with Esperanza, a training company, to put together an 11-day life coaching camp for the distressed women. At the camp they will be educated using a holistic approach, on conflict resolution, personal finances, relationships, on improving their general emotional well-being and about setting and reaching goals. After graduation on November 6, they will each get a coach from a local church assigned to them for six months, guiding the empowered victims into life and job-training programmes.    Restiau stated that they actively reach out to girls who work in prostitution in and around the Mbombela area. “We pray with them and offer them love and friendship, give them hope and encourage them to dream big and go forward in life. We provide them with discipleship training and skills training and connect them to the right government departments or schools,” she said. The SAPS crime statistics for Mbombela reveal that total sexual offences committed, increased by 14.8 per cent for the 2018/2019 financial year.
