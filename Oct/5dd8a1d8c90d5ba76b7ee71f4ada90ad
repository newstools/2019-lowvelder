   11:30 – UPDATE: Eskom gives clarity on the reason behind the load-shedding  Eskom would like to inform South Africans and all its customers that the electricity system has been severely constrained this week. As a result of the loss of additional generation, delays in the return to service of units that are on planned maintenance and limited diesel supply, it has become necessary to implement stage two rotational load-shedding from 09:00 until 23:00 in order to protect the power system from a total collapse. In the system status briefing on September 4 Eskom warned that in order to avoid load-shedding, unplanned breakdowns needed to be contained at below 9 500MW. In the event generator breakdowns are experienced beyond 10 500MW, there will be high usage of emergency resources (diesel and pumped storage generators), which may lead to load-shedding if supply constraints are sustained for a long duration.

The supply constraint is caused by, among others, five generating units that are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks. In addition, a conveyor belt supplying Medupi Power Station with coal failed on October 12, resulting in low volumes of coal being supplied to the power station thus limiting the generating capability to approximately half the station output. Due to the shortage of generating capacity from coal-fired generation, the pumped storage and OCGT generators have been used extensively since October 12 which has led to a decline in the dam levels and diesel tank levels. We unreservedly apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them and want to assure the nation that we continue to work tirelessly to ensure security of energy supply. To assist us in these efforts, we appeal to customers to continue to use electricity sparingly throughout the day:
• Set air-conditioners’ average temperature at 23 degrees Celsius
• Switch off your geysers over peak periods
• Use the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time
• Set your swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time for optimal energy use.
• At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch. Avoid stand-by or sleep mode.  We will keep customers informed if there are any further changes to the power system.    09: 30 – Eskom earlier today declared a power system emergency. Stage two load shedding will be implemented from 09:00 to 23:00 today (Wednesday) due to a “shortage of capacity”, the energy utility confirmed. According to well known resident, Thea Rix,  load-shedding stage two and load curtailment stage one and two will be implemented to stabilise the system. Curtailment is the action of reducing or restricting power. According to their official Twitter account, a statement with more details will be made available at a later stage. It has alerted the public that load-shedding has returned. #PowerAlert Due to a shortage of capacity stage 2 loadshedding is to be implemented from 9 am to 11pm today.

More information will be published as soon as it becomes available. In September, Eskom said that no load-shedding was implemented during the winter period, and while no load-shedding is expected over summer, the risk remains as the system is still tight and vulnerable.
