 MARLOTH PARK – A 53-year-old man and 75-year-old woman from the Netherlands were killed on Wednesday afternoon. The incident happened in the man’s house in Seeikoei Street. According to Brig Leonard Hlathi,  two men approached the house. “They demanded work, to which the family said there was none at the moment that they could offer. “Suddenly more men appeared, with one of them wielding a firearm. “The suspects tied the victims up and covered their mouths with cloths. They took some valuable items, and fled the scene.” The owner of the house and a female visitor later suffocated to death as a result of the gagging. The man’s wife (53) and mother (80) survived the attack and managed to reach the panic button at around 22:15. They were rushed to hospital where they are receiving treatment. Police have refused to release any names until the victims’ next-of-kin overseas have been notified. Police have opened two counts of murder and urged anyone with information to contact Sgt Vusi Moses Thobela on 082-449-0242. ALSO READ: Drought in KNP devastating for animals
