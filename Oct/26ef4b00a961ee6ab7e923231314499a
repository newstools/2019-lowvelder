 MBOMBELA – On Tuesday, a motorcade on a Last Patrol through West Acres, preceded the service in honour of Mamba. The service was led by Past Sean Bushney from Bomb Shelter Bikers Church in Sabie. Aside from family and friends the service was well-attended by emergency and security personnel from the entire Lowveld.  It was also live-streamed for those who were unable to attend. A story booth was set up for family and friends to share memories of Mamba of which a video will then be compiled and shared with his youngest daughter, once she is old enough.

The board is a gift for Roxanne, his wife.  John Meintjies, a close friend and colleague, led the eulogy. “It was an epic farewell to an epic person,” he said. “Thank you to each person who made it special. Legends don’t die, they become greater. #ForeverLegendForeverMamba. Rest well ou Grote.”  ALSO WATCH: KNP visitor gets out of car to video lions  Video Credit: Sven Musica of Phonix Capture
