 So what do you do now? What information will you need to provide the road service operator? 1. If possible pull onto the shoulder of the road as quickly and safely as possible. Remember to signal and try to remain on level ground. Alternatively, if you need to pull into the emergency lane, ensure that you are as far away from moving traffic as possible. Immediately turn on your hazard lights.  Do not risk injury by attempting to push your car to a safe location. If you are uncertain about your safety and think your vehicle may be struck from behind, do not stay in your vehicle. Leave your vehicle only if there is a safer area to move to, away from the highway. But keep in mind, these are dangerous times,  and a breakdown is more than just an inconvenience, it can be life-threatening. Ideally, you should remain in your car with the doors locked. 2. Note your vehicle’s location and look for visible landmarks 3. Assess the vehicle’s operating problem but if you are not skilled do not attempt any repairs. Do not open the bonnet of your car as this will block your view. You will be unable to see if anyone is approaching.  5. Call for professional emergency assistance. Most insurers offer emergency roadside assistance. It is important to give all the relevant details of your location, with landmarks, so that you can be quickly and easily found by emergency professionals. Ensure that you stress the fact that you are vulnerable. ALSO READ: Karino Interchange expected to ease traffic flow
