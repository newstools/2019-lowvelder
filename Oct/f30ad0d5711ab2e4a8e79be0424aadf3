Long John was on stage Friday and Saturday and proved himself to be a real party starter.
During the day the Sousaphonics Oompah Band entertained with mostly instrumental pieces of October festival music. Sunset Sweatshop performed just before Die Heuwels Fantasties and lead singer Ian Heyns had a powerful stage presence while performing a crowd favourite “Coming along”.  Die Heuwels Fantasties was one of the bands most people wanted to see. Their “Pille vir Kersfees” and “Leja” got the audience on their feet and singing along to their old time favourite songs.

Juanita and Hendrik Kruger was so excited to wear their authentic German attire to the OktoberFest.
They attended the biggest Oktober Fest in the world in Munich four years ago and bought their lederhosen and dirndl there.  Juanita said, ”I am glad that I got the chance to wear my dirndl again, I never thought that I will be able
to reuse it.”
