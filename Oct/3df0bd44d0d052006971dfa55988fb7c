 A local family is appealing to the kidnappers of a 53-year-old woman to make contact with them or the local police, and begging for the safe release of their beloved wife and mother. In a desperate attempt to create awareness that might save her life, some details have been released. The family said they have heard nothing since the incident, but are assuming that a ransom will be demanded. “We are asking the kidnappers to please make contact.” ALSO WATCH: Bossies Justice celebrates a decade of crime fighting He begged for them to please not hurt her. The incident occurred after she left The Grove shopping centre.  It is thought that she was followed by the kidnappers and as she slowed down at the entrance road of the estate, they allegedly overtook her and braked hard. Samgi must have hit the back of their vehicle as her number plate fell off at the scene. Samgi’s driver side window was smashed by allegedly a hammer. They then presumably jumped in the car and raced off. Samgi’s vehicle was found abandoned on the N4 close to the Cairn turnoff. “It was standing on the left side of the road, and someone must have called it in.” What was odd is that all her personal belongings, such as her handbag, credit cards and all the family’s passports, were strewn across the car, but it looks as if nothing was taken.

Elawini expressed their deepest concern for the family, as they are a “deeply respected part of the Elawini family.” Unfortunately due to the distance from the gate to the road, the CCTV cameras were unable to pick up any footage.
