Each art piece shows a part of the artist, either in a portrait of themselves, a personality trait or a relative who means something to them.    Kaitlyn Steyn sketched three portraits, one of her mother, her grandmother and herself for the “heritage” theme their art teacher, Michelle Booysen, had given them.  Taylor Dedekind created a striking range of pieces for the “liminal” theme. “Teacher Michelle asked us what liminal means to us,” said Taylor.    “Liminal sounds like ‘dreams’ to me, so I sketched animals on children storybook pages, as if a young child would dream about it.” Taylor said that she prefers to draw, but also likes other art forms as well.  Josh Klukow’s dramatic piece of a metal man welded together also stands out. “He created these pieces in the art class,” said Booysen.  “These students love art class and do not mind spending hours creating and expressing themselves through art,” she added.
