What is more, its location is very favourable – Westend is located conveniently close to most suburbs and right next to Mediclinic Nelspruit. The centre has also turned 18 this year and remains one of the friendliest shopping centres in Mpumalanga.
The centre was a life-long dream of founder, Hans Geldenhuys. The ground was broken in 1999/2000. He did all the earthworks himself. Following a construction period, the centre was officially opened in April 2001. The stores at Westend Shopping Centre will fulfil your everyday needs, with a SUPERSPAR grocery and TOPS at SPAR liquor store, a Sasol filling station, as well as ABSA, Standard Bank and FNB ATMs. If you need a memory card or to replace a cracked mobile screen, the electronics shop Cell Well is handily located here.  Look no further than here for Van Heerden Pharmacy’s wide range of medications and toiletries, as well as a clinic. There is also a doctor’s room and Minette van Heerden Optometrist. Few people can live without their gym and hair salon – or even dry cleaners/laundromat and an internet cafe at times.  All of these are available from the convenient one-stop centre. For social visits, the centre hosts a Spur restaurant, as well as delicious takeaway outlets Debonairs Pizza, Fishaways and Maroti’s for those times when you are not eager to cook. The Bean & Blossom Coffee Shop is also set to open soon. The Nut Shack and Bakgat biltong shop will bring flavour to any lunch box. Purple Ribbon Boutique, Dots & Odds gift shop, and FDesigns jewellery store cater for more special occasions. Westend Shopping Centre remains a family business. This makes for a personal connection with tenants, and they continue to improve to keep it at top standards.
