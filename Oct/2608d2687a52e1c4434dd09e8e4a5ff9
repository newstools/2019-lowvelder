 The evening was filled with breathtaking classical melodies, played on the harp and piano. Walter Fourie also participated with a stunning vocal rendition of “Il Mio Tesoro” and concluded the evening with “Ride on, King Jesus”. Four of Prinsloo’s students (Trinity College of London grade seven and eight students) entertained the audience with pieces they had played for their examinations, giving them a chance to show off all their hard work over the past months.
