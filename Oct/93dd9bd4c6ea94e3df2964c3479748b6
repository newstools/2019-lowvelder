 • Preparation is key – make sure you have the schedule times handy and in an easy-to-see spot (like on the fridge). This way you will be able to plan in advance. • Go solar – There are more options these days for solar-powered appliances, ranging from solar-powered geysers to solar-powered lamps. If solar isn’t an option due to budget, there are other ways to make sure that your water stays hot (insulation and/or getting creative with pipes) and that you have some light (enough torches or lamps – and make sure that you have batteries and that they are charged!) • Make sure that all your devices (cellphones, tablets, laptops, etc. are charged.

You can also set up a rechargeable battery to run an LED globe for light, which is safer than lighting candles. • Gas – You don’t need to buy a whole new stove or oven, just make sure you have a camping gas stove for emergencies. Even better – turn an unpleasant situation into a good one by roasting marshmallows with the family after dinner. ALSO READ: Mbombela woman kidnapped in broad daylight
