 Construction workers at the Mpumalanga parliamentary village site allege that they are treated unfairly by the contractor. On Wednesday they downed tools and blocked the old airport road, demanding that White Hazy Building Construction respond to their demands. Motorists could not use either lane of the road for several hours.   The construction workers blocked the road with debris, rocks and burning tyres at the site’s gate.

The workers from White Hazy Building Construction allege that they did not receive annual salary increases in September, their uniforms are torn, they get paid late and they are forced to sign for nine hours a day, while they work for ten.    They allege that the company said they received increases in the previous year. “It is unfair for us, because we work very hard every day and we are not getting increases. The owner of the construction company has an easy life while we struggle. We have tried on several occasions to voice our concerns, but nothing happens after that,” said one of the protesters.

The construction workers from Clear Choice Builders said they were happy with almost everything except their salaries. Bhayela Manonga, chairman of Clear Choice Builders, said they only increase salaries for those who have been working for the company for more than 12 months. At the time of going to press, White Hazy had not responded to the enquiry. Later on Wednesday afternoon the road was opened after police went to the scene.
