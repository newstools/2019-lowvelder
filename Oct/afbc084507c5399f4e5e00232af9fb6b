 MBOMBELA – The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997(BCEA), contains provisions which must be contained in some form or another, in all contracts of employment. The provisions contained in the BCEA allows for some flexibility by employers, but only to the extent where another law provides for more beneficial terms. It applies to all employees, with the exception of members of the National Defence Force, the National Intelligence Agency and the South African Secret Service.

An employee must be paid within seven days after the end of the period for which it was due, and all deductions from an employee’s salary are prohibited, unless agreed upon, or if the deduction is allowed by law, for example UIF and tax deductions.

It employs inspectors who are required to investigate complaints against employers. Should an employer fail to adhere to a compliance order issued by an inspector, the DoL may ask the labour court to make the order an order of court. An employer may be jailed or fined, if found to be in contempt of the order made.
