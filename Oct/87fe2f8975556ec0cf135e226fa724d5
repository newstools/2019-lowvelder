 The electricity system remains extremely constrained and vulnerable this morning and any unexpected shift such as unplanned breakdowns could result in loadshedding at short notice. “Yesterday, at approximately 13:30, we experienced a fault on the 400kV Gumeni transmission line connected to the Hendrina Power Station,” Eskom’s statement read.  This impacted electricity supply to Pullenshope, Hendrina town and surrounding areas. Power was restored to affected customers yesterday and the restoration of Hendrina Power Station is progressing well. “The incident is under investigation.” Eskom assured the public that recovery teams continue to work tirelessly to return some of the generating units from planned and unplanned maintenance while they are currently using some of their emergency reserves to minimise probability of loadshedding.
