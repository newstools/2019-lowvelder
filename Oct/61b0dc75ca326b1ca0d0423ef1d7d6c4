 The air smells of burning; acrid, chemically infused and you are choking, your lungs charred. As flames engulf your house, you desperately look for an escape as the fire scorches your skin and singes your hair.  This week is international Fire Prevention Week, and this year’s campaign recognises the everyday people who motivate their households to develop and practice a home fire escape plan. This past weekend a Malalane family managed to escape a devastating house fire with literally moments to spare.

Talia apparently woke up and managed to get her mother and grandmother out of the houses that was already filled with black smoke. A family friend confirmed that Tania only had time to grab her glasses and her cellphone.  “Tania’s mother, who is 74 years old, could not even put on a gown.” She added that the Cronje family – who lost everything in the fire – are no strangers to hardship and that Tania’s husband passed away 13 years ago. Neighbours and MBM Protection managed to bring the fire under control.  “A fire escape plan can literally save your life.” Deon Broekman, head of the Lydenburg Fire Brigade, advises that you walk through your home and inspect all possible exits and escape routes. Households with children should consider drawing a floor plan of your home, marking two ways out of each room, including windows and doors.

A closed door may slow the spread of smoke, heat and fire. “If you can not escape, then try to get to your bathroom, get in the shower or run the bath and get in. Close the door and place wet towels beneath the door. And open the window to let in fresh air.” He confirmed that the majority of house fires are caused by electrical faults. “Always check your power points, and don’t use too many power cords at one outlet.” He warned against placing an electrical cord under a carpet, as this gets stood on too often and the damage can lead to sparks.  Last week another house caught fire in Barberton, but Barberton EMRS managed to get it under control before it spread too far. How can I prevent a house fire? • Keep the stove and oven clear.
