 This will be a sunny week for the Lowveld; not always hot, but sunny.  If you would like to plant veggies, here are a list of vegetables that will thrive in these hot, humid temperatures.   Sweet potatoes – Grow well in the summer and produce within 90 days. Southern peas – As green-shelled peas, they make a delicious side dish or salad topping. Long beans – Also known as asparagus beans, they have a sweet nutty flavour similar to the spring spears. Sunflowers – The plants will grow and flower, producing edible seed for the family or the local wildlife, without the gardener lifting a finger. Eggplant – Eggplant is the best hot-weather producer of the tomato and potato family crops. ALSO READ: The powerful health benefits of turmeric and curcumin – here’s what you need to know
