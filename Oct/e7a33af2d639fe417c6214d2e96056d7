 MBOMBELA – Cheryl Reum, an ex-Lowvelder, planted the seed which sparked the inspiration to create the #ImStaying Facebook group. The 400 thousand-plus member group came into existence only three weeks ago. It is dedicated to South Africans who come with a willing spirit to create a positive difference.

Reum, a realtor and property developing entrepreneur, is a former Nelspruit High School student with a contagious attitude. As Winston Churchill once said, “Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” This saying indeed speaks volumes, in this case where a woman with a remarkable positive mindset encouraged Jarette Petzer to found the group with a true ubuntu philosophy of sharing is caring.

She wanted to bring light back into this world by an idea that crosses all borders of religion and race, to drop the walls of division and create a unified country.    Reum told Lowvelder that she has a strong passion to be heard, to spread the truth, to be an icon in Africa and this is what drives her. “The negativity and darkness that has been so prevalent in our country in the last months was becoming totally oppressive and being a light worker, I was already active in finding ways to ignite sentiments of interaction of love and positivity between people of all races and creeds.”
