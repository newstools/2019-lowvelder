 The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) is not doing enough to create an economical environment conducive to growth. Private stakeholders and the CMLM met last week to review the council’s five year Integrated Development Plan (IDP) for the period of 2017/2022 at the Mbombela Civil Centre. The CMLM lists their priorities in a nutshell as being economic growth and job creation, the expansion of infrastructure, which includes proficient service delivery, spatial transformation and fighting crime.     Linda Grimbeek, chief operating officer of the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT), said during the meeting that the City is not proactive enough to create the necessary jobs. According to Grimbeek, “there is nothing tangible going on to spur on job creation. “The municipal plan says nothing about tourism and tourism operators closing down,” she said.
Grimbeek spoke about the challenges of land invasions, protests, water security and service delivery as the main challenges that impede economic growth. “There were 64 protests in 100 days, where people could not go to the Kruger National Park,” she said. It is imperative, according Grimbeek, that the CMLM support and cooperate with the private sector to create more jobs. She stated that government on its own cannot create all the jobs necessary to eradicate unemployment. They need the participation of local businesses and for businesses to fulfill their role, for which a lucrative economical setting is needed. “We should devise plans together. Why does the municipality want to be a reactionary government? Why not be a leading, proactive government?” she asked.

Dumisani Mabuza, general manager of city planning and development, conceded that it is difficult given the economic challenges to create the jobs they want to create. “But half a loaf is better than none,” he said. Municipal initiatives like the creation of job opportunities through the Community Works Programme (CWP), Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), youth development programmes and the implementation of capital projects are commendable, but generate employment at a snail’s pace.  Mabuza also touched on the subject of land invasion and community protests in response to the concerns raised by Grimbeek. He said there are people driving these invasions and that they need to deal with these issues. “We must encourage the communities not to occupy land without the municipality’s consent.” The City’s plan pertaining to protests that cause delays to various projects and activities is to urge the communities to take ownership of the projects implemented in the respective areas and to encourage them to find more appropriate ways of addressing their concerns, without interrupting the implementation of projects.
