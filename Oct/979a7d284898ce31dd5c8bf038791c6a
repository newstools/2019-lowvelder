 “The first nine months of this year were challenging due to the economic and political climate, but the Volkswagen Passenger, Audi and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands’ determination, innovation as well as leveraging of key vehicle introductions, ensured we continue to keep our position as the passenger car leader in South Africa,” said Mike Glendinning, director: sales and marketing, VWSA. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, South Africa recorded domestic sales of 49 191 units in September, a decline of 439 units or 0,9% from the 49 630 vehicles sold in September last year. The Polo Vivo was South Africa’s best-selling passenger car in September with 2 540 sales. With only nine working days of sales, Volkswagen’s new compact SUV, the T-Cross, sold 810 units in September, an average of 90 units sold every day until the end of the month. From January to September 2019, Volkswagen has sold 52 382 units and achieved a market share of 20,2% in the passenger car market, an increase of 0,6% versus 2018 YTD.
