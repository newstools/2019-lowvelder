 MBOMBELA – Wisani Ngobeni (43) was convicted of forgery, as he had defrauded a medical aid scheme over a period of four years. Monica Nyuswa, the provincial spokesman for the Directors of Public Prosecutions (DPP), stated that Ngobeni was the sole owner of Wisemed Pharmacy at Acornhoek in Mpumalanga. He unlawfully and intentionally instructed his employees to forge medical scripts by using names of various doctors operating around the province. Further investigations provided the necessary evidence needed to arrest him. He subsequently pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court.
