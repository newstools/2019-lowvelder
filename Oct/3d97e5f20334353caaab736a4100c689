This is the second year this event took place, with Hilary Marx at the helm of this initiative. “We are fortunate to be able to organise such an event. I am a mother of a special-needs child myself, and know how easily mothers put their children first and themselves last.”  Cindy Pienaar, a hairdresser from Mbombela, also dedicated her time for the second year to help with organising the event, and Ananje de Bruin assisted with the social side of the planning.   More than 10 professionals in the beauty industry (therapists, hairdressers and nail technicians) gave up their time to offer free beauty treatments to the supermoms.  Diane Jordaan, from Diane’s Hair Studio, said she loved the initiative. “I love to contribute to make these moms feel beautiful and want to tell all the other moms out there: apply colour to your lips, and you will feel brand new again.”  Also Read: Lowveld High School awards top learners  Mary-Ann Marais, a mom who attended the evening, said she would not want her life any other way. Her four-year-old son has Down’s syndrome, and she describes him as awesome.    Liezl Vermaak has a daughter with cerebral palsy and said you must have a positive mindset. “If you fall into a trap of acceptance, and stop trying to create a better life for your child, it will become difficult and you would sink.”
“We would like to do this for mothers of children with special needs for many years to come,” Marx concluded.
