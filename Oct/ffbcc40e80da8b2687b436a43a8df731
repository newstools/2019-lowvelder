 LYDENBURG – Deon Broekman of Rapid Response told Steelburger/Lydenburg News that despite all the efforts of medical personnel workers, Antje Fitzner (54) succumbed to her injuries last Friday. Fitzner was travelling with German family members and had just landed the very same day in South Africa. The family was travelling in two separate vehicles when the first collided head-on with another vehicle from the opposite direction on the Dullstroom road.

According to Johan Harmse of Rapid Response, this was on account of severe internal bleeding. She also suffered a head injury, a pelvic fracture and other internal injuries. Fitzner was the only patient who suffered severe injuries during the collision. Other family members travelling in the same vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle sustained only slight injuries.
Fitzner’s remains will be repatriated back to Berlin, Germany.
