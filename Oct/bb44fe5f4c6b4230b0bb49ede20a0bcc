 Winnie Mabuza, wife of the late Joseph Mabuza, wants someone to be held accountable for his death. It has now been 10 months since the 47-year-old senior communications manager of the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison died in a collision between his motorcycle and a bakkie. The vehicle allegedly made a U-turn on the N4 towards Mozambique just before the Nkomazi toll gate and the driver allegedly fled the scene. The suspect is still at large.

We still have confidence in the police and we understand that they have processes that they have to follow. We had hoped that by now the suspect would be arrested. We know that the police work closely with the department of safety,” she said. Winnie said that it has not been easy for her and her family. “It is unfortunate that it is his birthday. We are still going to have to face December 23 (the day he died) and December 29 (the day of his funeral),” she said.

He killed someone’s child, someone’s husband and someone’s father. We know he will never live again although he lives within us. We have not accepted his death and maybe one day we will.” On the day of his funeral the police said that they had established the identity of the driver of the bakkie. “It is not easy because we have to rely on the police for information. The last time we got an update we were told that the administrative process of searching for the suspect was done.” Provincial police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi, said there is no new information at this time.
