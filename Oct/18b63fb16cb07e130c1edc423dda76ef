 BARBERTON – Mazwita Private Bush Camp on the R40 was the scene of a gruesome find on Tuesday morning. The body of a farmworker was discovered on the outside of the perimeter fencing in the early hours of the morning by another farmworker who alerted the police. “The farmworker, who is estimated to be about 25 years old, was found dead on Tuesday morning by other workers who alerted the Barberton police,” said Barberton police spokesman, Capt Jabu Ndubane. Ndubane added that a security guard on patrol the previous evening claimed to have heard what he purported to be two men having a heated argument. As he neared the two, the security guard said he heard gunshots and, fearing for his own safety, fled the scene. Investigations into the murder are ongoing and anyone who may know the victim, is asked to contact the Barberton Police Station on

According to Ndubane, once Khumalo opened the door, two armed men forced their way into the house, demanding to see him. Once he identified himself, one of the men shot him twice in the head. “His wife managed to escape and the two men fled the scene on foot,” Ndubane said. According to the police report, the motive for the killing is suspected to be that Khumalo was a key witness in an armed robbery case in Bushbuckridge which was due to resume in the Bushbuckridge Magistrate Court this past Monday. No arrests have made yet and the police are investigating the murder. Anyone with information which may lead to the suspects’ arrest, are asked to contact the Barberton police.
