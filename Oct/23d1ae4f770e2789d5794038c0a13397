 There’s something magical about going to a ballet production.  Maybe it is the graceful movements across the stage, like flower petals swaying in a light breeze.  Ballet Day encourages you to get out and go watch a ballet production again, or for the first time if you have not already. ALSO READ: When on thin ice, just dance! This is the sixth annual World Ballet Day. The Royal Ballet started the original idea, in 2012, and live-streamed a nine-hour day of behind-the-scenes footage, which drew 200,000 viewers, and, since then, over 3.6 million viewers to the YouTube archive. In line with this year’s theme of “Every Body Can Dance,” the Royal Opera House will today open its doors to everybody and anyone; offering activities, demonstrations, a free lunchtime performance, all in addition to what is being streamed live online (via Facebook and YouTube).  Lowvelders have at least three local productions to choose from. June Cruse’s ballet school will end their ballet year with a parents evening on 12 November at 17:30. Surané’s Dance Academy presents their production: Raising the Barre on 26 and 27 November at the Mbombela Civic Centre. Zanelle Pinker School of Ballet will host their show on 29 October.
