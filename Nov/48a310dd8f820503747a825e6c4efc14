It was part of a campaign against violence toward women and children.  The car dealership had well-experienced professionals assisting the women with the required defence techniques. Jaco Coetzee, used vehicle floor manager, said the dealership is 100 per cent behind the support for women.

Coetzee said they are planning to host another defence class. “We believe that all women should be able to protect themselves.
