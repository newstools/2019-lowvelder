“The people of Mpumalanga will no longer have to travel hundreds of kilometres to Pretoria or Johannesburg for the services of advocates, as the Mpumalanga Bar is home to skilled advocates. This means that the constitutional imperative of access to justice is no longer a pipe dream, but a reality for the people of the province.” During the evening, the Mpumalanga Bar also congratulated their nine newly graduated advocates, and also the Pupil of the Year, Wilma Kasa.
