 The World Cup- winning Springbok team will be visiting Mpumalanga next year. This was confirmed by Andy Colquhoun, general manager: communications of SA Rugby, on Monday. During the past week the SA rugby players embarked on a tour around the country to show off the Webb Ellis Cup, visiting major cities around the country. Smaller provinces were excluded, which caused an outcry, especially in Mpumalanga which has produced five Boks in the squad, Duane Vermeulen and Faf de Klerk from Mbombela, S’busiso Nkosi from Barberton, Trevor Nyakane from Bushbuckridge and Kwagga Smith from Lydenburg.
