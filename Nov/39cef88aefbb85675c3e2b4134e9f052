 It is the second High Court to be opened since 1994 and marks each of the nine provinces having a High Court of their own. The court came into operation in May, but this morning’s presidential launch will be attended by Ramaphosa and justice minister Ronald Lamola. It is hosted by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, with the Office of the Chief Justice. The court ensures that people from Mpumalanga no longer have to travel to Pretoria to attend to legal matters which require the High Court. “The launch bears testimony to the strides that the department has made in its endeavour to broaden access to justice through infrastructure development,” the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development said in a statement.
