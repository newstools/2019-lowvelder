 It is rated as a grade 4 in winter and as high as a grade 5 in summer, due to rain and slippery mud surfaces. Percy FitzPatrick was one of many in the 1800s who brought supplies up from Delagoa Bay (now Maputo) to Barberton using this route.  Each wagon had a team of 12 to 16 oxen and because of the heat during the day, they travelled in two four-hour shifts. The first before sunrise, and the next after sunset. They seldom managed more than 20 miles a day. The wheels of the wagons were locked, forcing the oxen to drag the wagons across the rocks. There is still evidence today of the wheel ruts in the rock.

The panorama and views are breathtaking as you ascend higher and higher. Participating on this trip were a range of different vehicles, including a Gelandewagon, Jeep 4J, Toyota bakkies, a Mazda Drifter, Nissan Patrol, and even a Suzuki Jimny.  The experienced run and route planner, Herman, took the lead on the day. All vehicles made it safely up and back down thanks to the extensive 4×4 experience within the group. It is a tough route and at times, even had the experienced drivers under pressure. Going up was challenging, but coming down had its own surprises, again forcing drivers to choose their lines carefully. The Lowveld 4×4 Club will be having its final meeting of the year on November 20 at 18:00.  ALSO READ: Ironman 4×4 SA Hilux Day Enquiries: Renier on 061-058-2161 or Wayne on 082-463-2767.
