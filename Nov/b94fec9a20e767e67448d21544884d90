 The all-new KIA Seltos is manufactured at two of KIA’s production facilities (in Korea and India), each catering to different regions, with South African models originating from KIA’s state-of-the-art new facility in India. A new entrant into the Indian market, KIA Motors commenced retail sales in India with the highest number of dealerships ever seen from a new car entrant into that market – a strategy that has proved successful. A highly competitive market, Seltos broke multiple records in India: KIA secured record first-day pre-bookings (6 046 units), as well as a new record for total pre-bookings prior to going on sale (31 786 units). During the first 10 days on sale, KIA Motors India clocked up a record 6 200 sales of the new Seltos.

Two lucky customers also stand the chance of winning an international KIA Seltos Experience: one winner will visit the home of KIA in South Korea for a unique K-Pop experience (including VIP attendance to the international K-Pop Music Awards in Seoul and meeting supergroup, BLACKPINK), while a second winner will have experience the Australian Open in Melbourne in January. The all-new KIA Seltos will go on sale nationally in the second half of November 2019. More information of specification and pricing will be released closer to the on-sale date.
