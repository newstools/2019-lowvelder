 MBOMBELA – The matter was remanded to January 15, 2020 for the trial to commence, after more than a year of investigations by the authorities. The 63-year-old was arrested during an early morning raid on September 6 last year at a security complex in Sonheuwel. The man cannot be identified until he has pleaded to the charges against him.

Lowvelder previously reported that the children had claimed that they were lured to the house by the man. “Some of them have even moved out of the complex as a result of this,” a source had disclosed. It was one of his bail conditions that the accused vacate his place of residence, and the magistrate even threatened to revoke his bail should it not happen. He was ordered by the court to move out of the security complex on May 17. He is currently residing in a local old age home.

Further postponements to acquire the social worker’s reports added to the delays.
