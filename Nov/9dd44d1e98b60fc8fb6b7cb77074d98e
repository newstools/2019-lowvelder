The wooden body was spray coated for protection, and the interior used luxury British woolen cloth. With no design drawings to work to, and with little knowledge of gasoline engines, car bodies or interiors, or any experience in production processes, Mitsubishi engineers overcame many difficulties and demonstrated that the domestic mass production of automobiles was possible. The Mitsubishi Model A was designed at the Kobe Shipyard of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company.  ALSO READ: WesBank Fuel Economy Tour coming up
