The focus is not so much on academics, but more on their vocational work skills that they learn and also behavioural traits. Every child gets their BEE certificate, which is either for their pride, friendliness or perseverance. On this day they also get a Christmas present,” she explained. They also announced the reps for 2020 and handed out trophies. “The main trophies are for sports. They partake in SASA-II, which are activities for children with intellectual impairments. We participate in most of those tournaments and the biggest award is the KaMagugu Star Award.    ALSO READ: 16 Days of Activism: What is violence against women and children?
