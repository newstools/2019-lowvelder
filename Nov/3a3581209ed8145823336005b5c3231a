 The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign starts today. Running from November 25 to December 10, it is a worldwide campaign to oppose violence against women and children.    Here are objectives of the 16 Days Campaign, according to www.gov.za: • Attract all South Africans to be active participants in the fight to eradicate violence against women and children
• Expand accountability beyond the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) cluster to include all government clusters and provinces.
• Combine technology, social media, the arts, journalism, religion, culture and customs, business and activism to draw attention to the many ways violence against women and children affects the lives of all people in all communities around the world.

• Encourage society to acknowledge that violence against women and children is not a government or criminal justice system problem, but a societal problem, and that failure to view it as such results in all efforts failing to eradicate this scourge in our communities.
