 MBOMBELA – Brig Leonard Hlathi, the provincial police spokesman, confirmed that he suspects a gang is targeting tourists. “It may be the same suspects who move from town to town, robbing foreign visitors,” he said. Last Tuesday, one victim and his wife were driving in a Nissan Qashqai rental vehicle on their way to an unknown lodge when, on the road at Mthethomusha in Pienaar, a black Volkswagen without number plates drove in front and another red vehicle pulled up behind theirs, obstructing their movement. The red car pulled over next to the passenger’s side where the female occupant was sitting. “One of the suspects threw a stone against the window and then forced them out of the car, threatening them with a knife,” Hlathi said.

They drove the victims’ car, which they had seized, to a nearby bush and abandoned it. Oupa Pilane, president of the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT), said he provided support to the distressed tourist couple. “They were driving from the Kruger National Park and got lost in Pienaar. They were clearly followed by two cars in a suspected gang-related operation.” In an incident on November 6, a tourist couple was driving on the White River main road from God’s Window tour at approximately 19:05. A white Polo suddenly blocked them off and two armed men wearing reflector jackets jumped out of the vehicle and approached them, pretending to be police officers. The suspects pointed a firearm at them, and forced them out of their vehicle and into the backseat of their Polo. They drove off with them and stopped in a bush, where the suspected kidnappers demanded their bank cards and banking details. “The one suspect was in possession of a speedpoint and tried to transfer an undisclosed amount of money, but due to a weak signal and network problems, the transaction was fortunately declined.” Hlathi said. The police impersonators left the two victims on the Sabie Road and fled the scene. The victims managed to get a lift from a truck driver who took them to the nearest police station. “We had a meeting with various stakeholders which included members of the SAPS Visible Policing Unit on Thursday,” said Tom Vorster from the KLCBT. The engagement was arranged by Lindiwe Mthombeni, manager of tourism safety for Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency.

Hlathi confirmed that no one has been arrested in connection with these incidents. He urged the members of the public who can assist with information to contact Capt John Mabunda on 082-449-0334.
