 MBOMBELA – Heleen Winterbach, a member of CB and one of the organisers of the event, said that everything turned out great for the elderly people of the old-age village. “They are not often visited by their children and therefore it is one of the highlights in their lives. They have enjoyed it thoroughly,” a delighted Winterbach explained. The CB, who have been operating for the past 16 years, entertained the senior citizens with a live karaoke performance by Tom Jacobie. A delectable variety of foods, including gammon, Coronation chicken, potato salad, Malva pudding and champagne were served and prepared by Ingrid Scheepers, to tantalize their taste buds.
