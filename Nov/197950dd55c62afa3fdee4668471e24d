 WHITE RIVER – Clint Cunningham, the lead singer, was first invited to play at the venue 18 years ago and only went from strength to strength from there. Cunningham stated that the Barnyard White River is their favourite place to play and carries a special place in the hearts of the band. “We had epic rock and roll shows which led to interesting adventures here. We have performed here three times before, as the last show under the pretence that the place is closing down, but it keeps on existing and they keep on inviting us back,” Cunningham claimed. The White River crowd in turn loves them, as they keep being invited back due to popular demand. The band pays a wonderful tribute to CCR with three musos who are wonderful at their craft. They manage to incorporate their strengths as a band into their music.

He told Lowvelder that CCR’s performance is consistently good. “The people love Clint because of his hilarious interaction with them.” Clint and Company on stage, during their Creedence Clearwater Revival show.
