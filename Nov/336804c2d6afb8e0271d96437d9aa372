 MBOMBELA – The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is embarking on a campaign to spread awareness to social grant beneficiaries about wise spending this festive season. In a statement, Senzeni Ngubeni, the Mpumalanga SASSA spokesman, said, “Beneficiaries must note that the social grant payment is not meant for a luxury life and to pay back loan shark debt, but must be utilised to buy basic needs. Social grant is an intervention for poverty alleviation.” He stressed that parents and legal guardians of child support grant beneficiaries needed to remember that the social grant was not meant for their needs but for the child’s.
