 GRASKOP – “How do they source this information?” asked SAPS spokesman Brig Leonard Hlathi. “It has become evident there is a syndicate operating in the Lowveld region orchestrating these robberies.” This follows another two incidents of holidaymakers being targeted in the area. A German couple was robbed on their way to Graskop on Monday night. The shaken foreigners disclosed that two armed men in a silver vehicle forced them onto the back seat of their vehicle and drove them to a secluded area. “The robbers took all their electronic devices, German identity documents and other items worth an estimated R47 000 and abandoned them in a bush, under strict instructions to stay there for 40 minutes,” Hlati said. In a separate incident last Friday at 20:30, a couple from the Netherlands and friends were travelling to their booked place, when they noticed a silver Polo Vivo following them, according to Hlathi.

The police are patrolling these main routes, but due to limited resources, cannot be present everywhere.
“There are tourist monitors deployed to look after these foreigners. We must work together to address this. There are people who know what is going on who must come forward.” ALSO READ: Swiss tourists attacked outside White River
