 HAZYVIEW – An accident scene in which the occupants suffered only minor injuries turned into a murder scene last Sunday. The incident occurred at around 03:00 when two vehicles were involved in a partial head-on collision on the R40 between Hazyview and White River. In a macabre twist to a run-of-the-mill accident, one of the drivers emerged from the wreckage and allegedly killed the other by strangulation.
