 Henry Brown, his wife, Martie, and son, Tommy, were attacked at their home on November 3.
The incident occurred at approximately 02:00 after a small gang of men gained entry to their house through a window. All three victims sustained serious head injuries during the attack. Tommy managed to fight back and one of the attackers was shot in self-defence. The attacker died.
The arrest followed after information was received from an informant with regards to the whereabouts of the suspect.
