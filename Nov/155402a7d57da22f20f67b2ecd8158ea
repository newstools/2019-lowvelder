 The Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport is unable to do the necessary maintenance to the province’s roads due to budget constraints. In an oral reply to a question in the Mpumalanga provincial legislature, the MEC for public works, roads and transport Gillion Mashego said it has repaired potholes across the province as part of the Sidudula Amapotholes programme.

They must be resealed after every eight years, but due budget constraints we are unable to do this,” he said.
