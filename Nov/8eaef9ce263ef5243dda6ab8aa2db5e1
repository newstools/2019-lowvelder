There are a few things that the public could do to help. We have a wish list from the patients – the things that they really want for Christmas,” Shawe said. Lowvelders are urged to help buy gifts for the children on the wish list or any contribution towards purchasing the gifts will be appreciated, for example, refreshments and Christmas cake. The gifts will be given to the patients at the festive party. Donations can be dropped off at the CANSA offices at 6 Annecke Street before December 2.
