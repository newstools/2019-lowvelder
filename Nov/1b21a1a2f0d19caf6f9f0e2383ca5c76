Aiming to offer an experience that lets customers relax and be themselves and deepens the bond between car and owner, the model offers a creative time and space that invites new ways of using a vehicle. Under the “car-as-art” ethos, the styling of MX-30 aims to raise its artistic value and expand the expressive range of Mazda’s Kodo-Soul of Motion design language.

Spaces in and around the centre console give the cabin an open feel, and environmentally conscious materials such as cork and fabrics made from recycled materials are used in ways that bring out their natural appeal, creating a comfortable interior space.
