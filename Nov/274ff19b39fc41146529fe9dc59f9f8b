 MBOMBELA – Curro Nelspruit’s annual valedictory service was recently held, during which the Grade 12s were awarded for their hard work and commitment towards academics on their last day of school. The event started with a beautiful message from Pastor Shaun Adams, from Church Unlimited. He has built a relationship with this specific grade, delivering devotions and motivational messages when he visited the school. Beautiful décor by the art department and musical items by our learners added to an emotional and befitting send-off for this dynamic group of Grade 12s. The head leaders of the school delivered a heartwarming address, in which they acknowledged the hard work and efforts made by the staff and parents towards making their tenure at school successful. Bianke Lottering and Bavukile Vilane each used the opportunity to highlight some of their most special moments with the Class of 2019.

The headmaster’s address, by executive head, Mike Bownes, was unique. He often referred to the well-known song by Frank Sinatra: “New York, New York” which he rewrote and actually sang parts of it. Filled with good wishes and hope, promised greatness and success to accompany every learner throughout the upcoming exams and young adulthood. He ended his speech with:
“We wish the Class of 2019 well in all their future endeavours and know that they will stand the school in good stead in their final examinations. “We would also like to acknowledge and thank the parents for entrusting their learners to our care. A strong partnership between parents and staff plays and incredible role in a learner’s upbringing, preparing them for future success,” he said. Top three learners in Grade 12:
