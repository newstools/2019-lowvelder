 November 14 is World Diabetes Day. With more than 3,5 million South Africans suffering from diabetes and an estimated further five million with pre-diabetes, most of whom are currently undiagnosed, the situation in South Africa is dire.   According to statistics, 60 to 80 per cent of women with PCOS suffer from insulin resistance. “I would describe the relationship between insulin resistance and PCOS as mutually destructive in that PCOS worsens insulin resistance, and vice versa,” says Dr Carmen James, an integrative medical doctor and holistic health and wellness coach from Durban.

While it is more likely for overweight and obese women to experience insulin resistance and PCOS, women of a normal weight can be affected too.  “It is important to remember that weight alone is not an absolute representation of health.”
James, who runs various workshops around the country on women’s health with a special focus on hormone health, strongly recommends that women with PCOS and/or insulin resistance address the underlying root cause drivers of their condition.

I recommend following a healthy diet, rich in plant-based foods and low in refined carbohydrates; enjoying regular physical exercise; adding supplements including myo-inositol, curcumin, antioxidants, folate and berberine; managing stress levels and getting good quality sleep,” she added. James explained that these measures will reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and begin to bring balance to the hormones to support ovulation.
