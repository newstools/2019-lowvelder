Founder, Dr Andre Hattingh, said that children are the innocent and fragile victims of their circumstances. “They are totally dependent on their parents or the government for help.”
Dave Walters handled the auction and encouraged everybody to, “make a difference to that one special child”. Corporate fund-raiser for Pediatric Care Africa, Lee Melman, shared some of the organisation’s remarkable initiatives. They provide basic medical equipment, establish a functioning and sustainable prenatal and postnatal clinic in war-torn and disaster areas, identify special needs children in dire need of highly specialised surgery, supply commercial baby formula and food to malnourished babies, and supply qualified and registered medical doctors, nurses, laboratory staff and X-ray technicians to governmental and non-governmental hospitals and clinics.  A programme currently running is the “1 000 operations for 1 000 children” initiative, or #helpmyop. Its purpose is to fund paediatric operations for children in desperate need of lifesaving medical care. If you wish to make a donation for this worthwhile cause SMS “CHILD” to 42515 to donate R30.
