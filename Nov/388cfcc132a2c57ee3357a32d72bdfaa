 WATERVAL BOVEN – Local law enforcers’ delayed response to a business robbery and hijacking on Friday evening set in motion an attack on the police station by angry residents. A resident, who did not want to be named, said, “Apparently there was a robbery between 23:00 and 23:30 on Friday. “The residents contacted police to report the incident and they did not respond in a timely manner, which caused the community to march to the station,” he said.
