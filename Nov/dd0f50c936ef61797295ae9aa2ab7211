 WATERVAL BOVEN – Lowvelder reported last week that Nkosi was allegedly shot by Mayisela, who was accompanying a security guard responding to an alarm at Mayisela’s neighbouring property. Nkosi allegedly attacked him. Police spokesman Brig Leonard Hlathi confirmed that Nkosi had previously been sent to prison for rape and completed his sentence in Middleburg Correctional Services in 2015. Priscilla Moshwane, Nkosi’s sister, told Lowvelder that he was selling clothes as a means of income and was planning to move to Pretoria next year.

Hlathi said Nkosi’s mother was fetched after the incident, but once they arrived at the scene, Nkosi’s body had already been removed by the coroner. He also confirmed that Mayisela was arrested on November 20 and taken to court, but that the docket was not placed on the roll. “The prosecutor indicated that he is still going to prepare a list of instructions to be followed by the police before we can continue with the court case. Once the instructions have been completed, the case will be sent to the director of Public Prosecutions to see if Mayisela will be prosecuted or not.” ALSO READ: Waterval Boven train disaster commemoration slammed
