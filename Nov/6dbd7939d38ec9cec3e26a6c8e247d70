 If Veedubs are your thing, but you could not make it to the annual VW Vintage Car Fest at Bohemian Groove Cafe in Kaapsehoop, you have seriously missed out. In 2018 it rained cats and dogs. 2019 brought glorious sunshine and clear blue skies, and more entries. The event, now in its sixth year, is organised by the hippiest couple in Kaapsehoop, Andrea and Charl Fourie.

So when surrounded by so many of these cute and some cuddly versions, it is an all-out return to sharing the baby-boomer and flower power mode with like-minded individuals. This fest is colourful, vibrant and loud and the Veedubs just love all the pampering and attention. There were flea market stalls selling anything from T-shirts to ice buckets. Prizes were also awarded in no less than 30 Veedub categories. Bookmark Saturday October 17, 2020. This is the date set for the next festival.
