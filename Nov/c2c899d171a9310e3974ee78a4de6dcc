The “Libera Me” performance featured Conroy Scott, a baritone from Cape Town, who flew up especially for this concert. “I am very impressed with the organisation of this concert; I did not think that there would be so many people,” Scott told Lowvelder. He sang in Europe for six years before returning to South Africa two years ago. “He also plays the double bass for the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, and is actually a qualified mechanical engineer,” Walter Fourie, the director of LCMA, explained.
