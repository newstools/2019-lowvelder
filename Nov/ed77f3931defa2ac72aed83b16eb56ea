 Learners’ art and creativity was put on display at the Penryn’s Art Prep Exhibition in the school’s Cultural Hall. The exhibition consists of the artwork done over 2019 by the visual art learners. Loraine Codd, the visual arts teacher, said creativity is a good trait for all children to take into the future. “Not specifically creativity artistically, but the ability of the mind to think in different ways and to look at things through different perspectives.”   ALSO READ: Women’s self-defence puts power in empowerment Codd said she chose one artwork from each child from grade one to seven. “It is mostly what I felt was the best, and it is a situation of variety. I have put it up so that the parents can come and see and create that culture of appreciation of art in a school environment,” she said. She claimed that as a teacher it is exciting to see how kids love to be in the visual art class. “Every child is creative. They have not lost that ability yet. When you see how they experience the success, how beautiful all their artwork can be and see that light in their eyes; I really enjoy it,” Codd said.

I have started creating folders, and then they will take all their work home. I am sure some of the parents want to frame it and display it in their homes,” she said. Some learners also visited the hall to admire their peers’ works.
