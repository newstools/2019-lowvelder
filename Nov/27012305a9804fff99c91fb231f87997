Your first line of defence in security is preventing a criminal element from gaining access to your property in the first place. This is the credo of Axxon, a video surveillance system which gives you real-time surveillance and also immediate warnings of possible unwanted activities. Crucially, the software has search and detection functions and can be triggered by specific actions: whatever your business or property needs. “It is proactive security, as opposed to the reactive style of alarms,” say SecuriSafe Consultants co-owners Ian and Kobie de Paiva. Axxon’s state-of-the-art intelligent video management software has been available in the Lowveld for some time, and was driven by the couple for their previous employer. Under SecuriSafe they have been installing the cameras for more than a year. Now SecuriView’s control room, from which they will monitor clients’ premises directly, is going live on December 1.
With only a few screens, they are already monitoring 200 sites.  Axxon software is completely different from regular CCTV (which the company also installs) in that the cameras can be triggered by any action you ask it to search, whether this is monitoring employees by day or your perimeter fence at night, detecting fire or catching thieves. The applications are endless. However, crucially, Ian explains, the system is aimed at stopping people from coming in and, once they are in, to help find them. The De Paivas share a passion for the system and what is does. The system is ideal for industrial sites and farms. Additionally, they have just entered into a partnership with Protrack to handle responses. Axxon Intellect is your choice when managing hundreds of cameras in a custom-built security system or when you need integrated CCTV with access control, perimeter protection, fire and security alarms, and sophisticated functions such as facial recognition, road traffic monitoring and bundled POS monitoring.   Each site’s system is custom designed. Clients can monitor their own sites on their phones and, should there be an incident, receive a full report and the footage via email immediately.
