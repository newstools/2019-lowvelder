 This award recognises Mabuza, the CEO of Ithuba, for her contribution to the South African education sector through the Eric and Charmaine Mabuza Scholarship Foundation. The foundation, established in 1999 by Mpumalanga business veterans, Adv Eric and Charmaine Mabuza, initially supported young and talented matriculants in the region in furthering their tertiary studies. Since then, its reach has expanded throughout South Africa, producing doctors, accountants, engineers, quantity surveyors and many more. “This award represents many years of hard work and determination towards the advancement of equal access to quality education for all South Africans.” She added: “The mission of the scholarship foundation is to eradicate poverty through education, particularly in previously marginalised communities. As a corporate leader, we know that there is still a lot to be done, but we are ready and willing to do our part. We look forward to another decade of serving the nation.” ALSO READ: Brave ranger single-handedly apprehends gang of rhino poachers One of the beneficiaries of the Scholarship Foundation, Dr Kate Lusiki, who now works at the Rob Ferreira Hospital, expressed her gratitude. “Since I started working, I have been able to renovate my mother’s house. I am currently staying with my older sister, who I am putting through college so that she can also have a solid educational structure.
“I am able to do these things for my family because the Mabuzas afforded me an opportunity for education. This foundation has been like a better life handed to me on a silver platter, and for that I am grateful.” The 2020 scholarship programme will be launched with the new intake on January 12.
