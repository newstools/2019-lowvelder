“News Cafe management acknowledges that there was a shooting incident this weekend outside its premises and a video that has been circulating on social media. However, the people fighting in the video were not patrons.” Owner, Harris Zwane wanted it to be on the record that, according to witnesses, the men had been involved in a road rage incident at a filling station across the road before they proceeded to the City Centre’s parking lot. “I am aware of the video and I can confirm that nobody was shot. Shots were fired in the air. It is unfortunate that their fight ended at the shopping centre where News Cafe is located. We can assure patrons that security measures have been set up and to date there have been no reports of carjacking or any criminal activities. We want to make sure that patrons are always safe with the services of a private security company. People should refrain from spreading false information about the incident.” News Cafe’s management has said the safety of its patrons remains a priority. Watch the video here.
