 Renault South Africa is proud to have been recognised as the most Fuel Efficient Brand in the 2019 Wesbank Fuel Economy Tour, an accolade which will stand the brand in good stead in a tough economy with consistent fuel hikes and economic hardships. The five-day tour presented many challenging conditions for all competitors, from mountainous terrain to stretches of congested town driving, single lane driving, roadworks, roadblocks, light rain and mist. Testing the fuel consumption of the 40 participating vehicles to the max, the objective of the contest was to try and simulate real driving conditions for true representation of fuel efficiency across the specified classes. Aside from the testing conditions, the tour spanned across one of the most picturesque routes, being the Garden Route, to several of SA’s major cities, Johannesburg, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, George and Cape Town, allowing for breathtaking scenery.
