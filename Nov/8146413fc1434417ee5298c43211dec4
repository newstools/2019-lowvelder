 BARBERTON – The bright lights of Hollywood are beckoning for local Afro-pop sensation, Thabiso Themba (19), who prefers the last name Ngomane. He matriculated from Emjindini Senior Secondary School last year and has been a singing sensation since grade four. About a month ago, the a capella crooner was selected among six other artists at auditions held at the Mercure Hotel by the International Presentation of Performers, who were on a scouting mission for artists who would be taken to Hollywood auditions and mentored in the United States.

While performing for the judges, I was extremely anxious, but my song choices wowed them.” He performed “All of Me” by RnB powerhouse John Legend and “Ngikuthandile” by local entertainer, Vusi Nova. When asked how he knew about the auditions, Themba replied that a friend sent him a picture of the poster and he could not pass up the opportunity. The road has not been an easy one for Themba, who joined local trio United Soul on his arrival in Barberton.

Themba performed at Da Loose Mongoose on Friday, and dazzled the audiences with his signature silky smooth voice in the genre he has become passionate about. In just a few weeks, he will make his way to Hollywood for the audition of a lifetime. The prospect of performing in front of strangers is one which is sure to unsettle even the most seasoned artist, but the young performer is determined to put his best foot forward. “It is important to make myself and my family proud through a strong performance, because I see music as a career,” he said.
