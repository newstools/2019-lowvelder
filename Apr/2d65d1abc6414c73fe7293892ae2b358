However, plans changed when the striking image of the devastation wrought by Idai arrived from Beira, where our reporter Tereasa Dias is spending the week reporting from. Back to Riley, she didn’t need much motivation to enjoy an early Easter chocolate egg, as you can see. Thank you to Christies at 32 on Russel for the venue and Coral Blooms for the flower crown. ” – Mireille de Villiers (news editor for Lowvelder) “Enjoy the resful days with friends and family.
