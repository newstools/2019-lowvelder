 BUSHBUCKRIDGE – The Muslim and foreign-born community will tomorrow march to the local court and police station to demand an end to the crime they are experiencing. In the latest incident, three men were attacked as they were leaving a mosque after prayers. Spokesman for the group, Muhammad Alam, says that on the night of the attack at the mosque on April 3, a group had just finished their prayers when two men entered the premises and started shooting. “It was a special night. We were supposed to pray all night.” They asked for guns, but no guns were to be had. One man was shot in the leg and another broke his ankle when he jumped over a wall in an attempt to get away from the attackers.
