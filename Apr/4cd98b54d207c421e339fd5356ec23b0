Lowvelder has started a virtual Easter egg hunt for adults to win great prizes. The newspaper hides a virtual Easter egg in one of our website stories and shares a clue on how to find it on our Facebook page. When an egg is found it must be captured with your device and sent to Lowvelder inbox on Facebook along with your contact details. Winners will be contacted by the digital team to claim your prize at the Lowveld Media offices. Hurry up time is running out!
