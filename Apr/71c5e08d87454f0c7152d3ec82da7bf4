Billy Joel said it so eloquently in his song the Piano Man “Son, can you play me a memory, I’m not really sure how it goes, But it’s sad and it’s sweet and I knew it complete…” We all have that one tune that gets stuck in our head that transports us to places we visited and memories we treasure. With the Sappi Sunshine Piano experience, music enthusiasts are encouraged to find the beautifully decorated piano that is always on the move in town and play it.
