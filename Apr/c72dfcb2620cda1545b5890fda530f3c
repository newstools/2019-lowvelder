 MBOMBELA – There are no leads following the attempted abduction of a mother at Curro Nelspruit on Monday. According to Nelspruit SAPS spokesman, Capt Zandile Gqawa, no arrests have been made, “but we have not stopped looking for the suspects.” Eyewitnesses say two men in a silver Ford Ranger pulled up next to the mother’s car and tried to pull her into their bakkie. Gqawa confirmed that the mother had been threatened with a firearm and that a case of attempted kidnapping was opened. An alleged similar incident in Barberton could not be confirmed by the police or security companies. Curro Nelspruit has given tags to all their parents and no one is allowed to enter without said tag or by signing in.

Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein recommends that people ensure they have a tracking system installed in their cars. “A hijacking usually happens at a traffic light or in your driveway. Be alert of your surroundings. Watch out for cars that might be following you or for people lurking around your vehicle.” ALSO READ: All smiles as grade ones begin at Curro
