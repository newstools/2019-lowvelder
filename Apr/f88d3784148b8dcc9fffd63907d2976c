What Lowvelders probably do not know is that across the region there are eight active masonic lodges, located in Mbombela, Waterval Boven, Lydenburg and Pilgrim’s Rest. The exact number of members is not known. Freemasonry is practised under many Grand Lodges, which set the same standards and promote the same principals as the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Routine Masonic lodge meetings are broadly similar to a Rotary Club – a register is called, minutes are taken, and updates on charitable and social events are shared and discussed.
