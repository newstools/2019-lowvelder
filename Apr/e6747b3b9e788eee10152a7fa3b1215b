 MBOMBELA – In an effort to address this, Wessa Lowveld is hosting a debate with two prominent speakers this month. Colin Bell and Dr John Hanks represent views on the opposite sides of the debate over whether to trade responsibly in rhino horn or not at all.
“Within Africa, the prevailing belief centres on pursuing responsible, sustainable trade in rhino products,” explains Dr Llew Taylor. “Further afield, and globally it seems, the belief is to significantly reduce demand, hence a complete ban on the trade.” These speakers are perfectly poised to give the audience a look into both sides of the argument. Bell was a safari guide in Botswana in 1977 when rhinos ranged wild and free. He is one of the few people who has witnessed the decline of rhino in the country and made a significant contribution to the reversal of that process. He is also a qualified economist.

Their debate is scheduled for April 24, the same week as Earth Day, which is celebrated on April 22 each year. It takes place in the auditorium at Penryn College at 18:00 for 18:30.
