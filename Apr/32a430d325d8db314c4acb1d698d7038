 The International Student Leadership Symposium 2019 opened at Uplands College on Monday. During the week grade 10 delegates from seven schools from all over the world joined hands to focus on leadership under the theme “Illegal Trade”. “Issues like wildlife trafficking and poaching will be discussed as well as the other side of this debate, namely breadline earnings, poaching for food and the knock-off trade where the humanitarian aspect will be explored,” said Sharon van Reenen at the opening. Delegates from countries including Oman, China, Belgium, Germany, the UK, USA, Argentina, Canada and South Africa were welcomed at the event. They were to consider and plan actions to take home and share with their peers, schools and communities.
