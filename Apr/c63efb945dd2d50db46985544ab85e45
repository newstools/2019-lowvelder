 HAZYVIEW – An armoured cash-in-transit vehicle was unsuccessfully bombed on the R536 at Shabalala near Hazyview on Saturday evening. No money was taken, but one security official was injured. The incident was confirmed by SAPS Hazyview. According to an official, the suspects were waiting for the FCS armoured vehicle just past the Hosanna Church on the road to Mkhuhlu, about 5,5 kilometres from Hazyview. When the driver passed, they followed from behind, but later drove up alongside the vehicle and fired shots at the tyres. The driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road. According to several reports, including those from another security company, the perpetrators pointed firearms at the crew and instructed them to disembark. Explosives were put on the safes, but failed to blow them open, hence no cash was lost. The suspects, however, took two rifles and a shotgun from the crew. One of the crewmen sustained an injury to his left thigh, but it is not clear whether he was hurt by a shot or shrapnel. An ambulance was sent to the scene to attend to him. The perpetrators – five men and two women and all armed – fled the scene in a white new-shape long-base Toyota bakkie. They sped off east in the direction of the Kruger National Park. No registration number is available for the vehicle. The investigation was handed over to the organised crime unit of the SAPS.
