 MBOMBELA – The Nelspruit SPCA will go to any lengths to make sure that their animals feel at home. An example of this is the new artificial human laps that they have brought into the kitten cages. These “laps” are made by volunteers who picked up old jeans from the SPCA’s charity shops and filled them with used materials like clothes, stockings, wool, or stuffing.
The leg holes and the openings at the tops are sewed shut, so that whatever the jean is filled with does not come out.

He encouraged volunteers to help them make more of these “laps” to accommodate all the kittens in the kennel. ALSO READ: KYK: Nelspruit DBV veg vir diere gedurende die feesseisoen
