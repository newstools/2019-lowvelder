 KABOKWENI – More than 2 000 people attended the launch of the election manifesto of the DA at KaBokweni Stadium on Saturday. “I am vividly reminded of our shift into the new South Africa. I am reminded of our unity as a nation, the screams, cheers and excitement, but most importantly I am reminded of the hopes, values and aspirations which our people held close to their hearts,” DA provincial leader, Jane Sithole said to the crowd of avid supporters.  According to her, she had travelled across the province and in spite of the beauty of Mpumalanga, she could not turn a blind eye to people’s suffering. She promised the supporters that the DA has a plan to ensure that all provincial residents benefit from the transition into democracy and that all have access to the hard-won freedoms.

According to her, as long as extreme deep poverty, high inequality and unemployment exist, the people of Mpumalanga can never be truly free. “I have seen communities who were sold the dream of running water but still share river water with animals as their taps have remained dry for over 20 years. I have seen pregnant mothers, the sick and the elderly queue for long hours at clinics and hospitals only to be told to come back tomorrow because our healthcare services are understaffed and under-resourced,” Sithole said.
