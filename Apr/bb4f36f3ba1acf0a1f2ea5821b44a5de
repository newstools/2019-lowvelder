 Their March outing took some 14 vehicles to a private farm in the Mara Conservancy. Here the vehicles were treated to an interesting and scenic route which did not cause discomfort or dislikes for either the drivers or the passengers, but still got the adrenalin going. The driver of the day, Johann Swanepoel from Lydenburg, walked his walk and talked his talk. Rumor has it though, that he will have to up it a level for the next event.  So Johann, you have been forewarned – the knives are being sharpened! The next club meeting will be on April 10. The venue still needs to be confirmed. Also diarise May 4 for a massive 4×4 event at the Mbombela Stadium in aid of CANSA. Vehicle entry fees will be R250. Enquires: Wayne on 082-463-2767
