The informant who witnessed this ran to a safe place in fear of the attackers hearing him as they assaulted the helpless Ntuthuko. After the noise subsided, the informant came out of hiding and directed the police to the scene, where the victim was lying in a pool of blood in the nearby bush. His face was swollen and he had multiple open wounds on the face, which seemed to have been caused by sharp objects. He later succumbed to his injuries.

He said it is believed that the victim had stepped into the prohibited territory of the rival gangsters, called the “Straghens,” and broke the code of limits. He said while police were on the scene, they obtained information that assisted them in their investigation. “While they were searching the suspects’ hideout, two dangerous weapons, a panga and a Rambo (knife) with blood stains on them were found. These weapons are believed to have been the ones which were used in the alleged crime,” added Mbokane.
