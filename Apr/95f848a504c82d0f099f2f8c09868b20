Vita Magnifica is run by chef Ray ensures that your tastebuds will be tantalised when you go to their restaurant for a meal.  The cuisine is a blend of African that is inspired by Italian. Guests can enjoy a lovely breakfast, lunch or dinner in a beautiful indoor or outdoor setting.  Vita Magnifica has a scenic view of the pristine Lowveld bush and has not one, or two, but three dining rooms for patrons to choose from.  Also, for some who are looking for a bit of laid back dining, there is a lounge area with a fully licenced bar, and a pool area for guests to cool down in on those scorching summer days. Vita Magnifica will have its grand opening on the 30th of March.  Vita Magnifica is the perfect place to host all your functions, whether it’s an intimate birthday party, or a big corporate event, there’s enough space to cater for all your guests.
