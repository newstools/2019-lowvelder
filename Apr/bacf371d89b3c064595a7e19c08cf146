 WHITE RIVER – The alleged rhino horn kingpin, Petros Sidney Mabuza (Mr Big), had a big day in court last Monday. He appeared for two different cases where he stands accused of, among other things, theft of rhino horns, illegal possession of rifles and live ammunition as well as obstruction of justice. For the first case, Mabuza was arrested in June 2018, with co-accused Nozwelo Mahumane, Moshe Thobela and Romance Khoza. In July he was released on bail of
R250 000, with one of the major arguments being that his health was deteriorating. Upon their appearance on Monday, their case was postponed. According to the National Prosecuting Authority’s provincial spokesman, Monica Nuyiswa, the reason for the postponement was to make copies of the docket and to wait for a date in High Court.

They were arrested in September last year during a 123-man operation.
Nyalunga was granted bail of R120 000 and was let off with a warning on an additional charge of illegal hunting, while Mabuza was granted bail of R90 000 on November 2.

Phineas was released on bail of R10 000 on October 8 at their second appearance. This case was also postponed. “This was so that the National Director of Public Prosecutions would have time to get a hold of the racketeering certificate,” Nuyiswa said.
