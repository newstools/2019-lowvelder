 Buzi – It’s my fifth and last day in Mozambique documenting all the relief effort by various aid organisations.  Earlier today Mercy Air’s pilot Paul Middleton had to land the plane on a dirt runway which had become like a mud bath. The previous day, the plane could not land and staff had to be transported by helicopter.  After a low flight over the runway to assess the condition of the ground, Paul made a daring land.

After loading some passengers, we took off once again back to Beira.  There we had to go through customs and get our passports stamped to come back to South Africa. Wet conditions over the town of Buzi on Friday.
