 BELFAST – Could someone run a distance close to a Comrades Marathon every day for five days? Is is possible to cover 400 kilometres on foot in under 65 hours for the racing pros or 120 hours for the average runner looking for a challenge? There is only one day left before local runner and hiker, Kevin Ruthven will take up this challenge. He is the only Mpumalanga entrant in the Munga Race 2019.  This event has attracted 19 entries this year and will kick off tomorrow at Lakenvlei outside Belfast. From there, Ruthven will take on the 400-kilometre challenge over rough mountain terrain in an attempt to conquer this seriously tough trail race.

The route will make use of forestry roads, jeep track, single track, the odd railway line and grassland. The route will use district dirt roads only when necessary. Ruthven expressed that his stress levels are now starting to rise. This week I was busy cutting open the trails for the race. It is part of the reason I got to enter the Munga.  He said that he put in extra training this week and ran his last 30 kilometres on Monday. “I aim to rest from Sunday to Tuesday before the race kicks off on Wednesday.” Ruthven said that this year 19 participants entered the race, five more than the previous year. “In the beginning, it was a very lonely journey, but thanks to growing support I feel positive and ready to take on the challenge. I want to thank Lydenburg for all their support. Ruthven said that he feels emotionally and physically ready for the craziest, life-altering experience one can have on your feet.
His progress will be followed on our Facebook. LEES OOK:  Douw rig sy visier op Afrika-kampioenskappe  Kevin Ruthven is ready for the Munga Race 2019 Kevin has 120 hours to complete 400km on foot.
