 MBOMBELA – It was an evening of theatrical celebrations when Penryn College hosted their annual Interhouse Plays. Each of the four houses got an opportunity to have their moment in the spotlight.  “Interhouse plays are completely student- driven. The students who are chosen to be directors have to fill their leadership role by auditioning their fellow students, organising rehearsal schedules, directing, producing and staging their very own play. It was remarkable to see the scholars come together on stage and perform a piece of theatre that they have worked so hard to produce,” said Joanne Steyn, head of culture at Penryn.
