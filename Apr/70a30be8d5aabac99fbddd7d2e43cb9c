 MBOMBELA – After being offline since last Thursday, the Department of Home Affairs’ connection was restored on Wednesday. When Lowvelder visited their offices on Thursday, there was no longer a queue outside. Instead, officials were seen at their posts, helping the customers. Lowvelder previously reported that hundreds of people, travelling from all over the Lowveld, were`negatively affected by the fact the office was not able to operate efficiently. Queues of more than a hundred people at a time were seen outside the department’s building on Monday, and by Tuesday there was still no clear indication of when they would be online again.
