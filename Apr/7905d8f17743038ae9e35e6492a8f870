MEC Pat Ngomane said in a statement that death and injury could continue to be reduced if all stakeholders worked together and road users behaved. He said that the government will ensure increased law enforcement visibility, roadblocks and road safety initiatives on all major roads. The department will further implement alcohol operations.  “The operations will focus on identified priority roads which are the routes that have contributed to most crashes and fatalities experienced during the previous holiday periods,” he said.
