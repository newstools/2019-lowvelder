 MBOMBELA – According to Penryn’s head of community service and organiser of the event, Joanie Whitfield, contestants had to raise R1 500 and do 10 hours’ community service beforehand. “All and all we managed to raise R30 000 that will be donated to Penreach for their Playday this year and I could not be more proud,” Whitfield said.  This, however, does not mean that the quality of the runway production was neglected in any way. The top-10 junior girls, senior girls and overall boys took to the stage in both casual and formal wear that displayed their beautiful hearts and personalities perfectly.  Thereafter the top five was chosen in every category and they had to answer a question provided by one of the esteemed judges: Yusenia Croublet, Jacques Lombard, Kgaugelo Ntini, Dante Lombard, Andile Ncotso and Marko Janse van Rensburg. Former contestant of The Voice South Africa and Penryn alumnus Lara Gear also entertained the audience. She thanked her alma mater for always accommodating her and for helping her to pursue her dreams. ALSO SEE: Man of remarkable talent joins Penryn Junior girls
