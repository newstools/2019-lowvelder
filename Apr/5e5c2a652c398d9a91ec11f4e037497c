 The sought-after award was presented at a spectacular function at Shepstone Gardens in Johannesburg on
April 4. Much like the actual venue (which was top secret, with guests shuttled there at the very last minute), the identity of the winner was a closely-guarded secret. So too were the runners-up, namely the Porsche Cayenne and Volvo XC40. George Mienie, AutoTrader CEO, believes that the A-Class is a truly deserving winner. “The AutoTrader South African Car of the Year has to represent innovation and ingenuity, while setting new benchmarks in its market segment.  There is absolutely no doubt that the A-Class does this,” he noted. The win was an extremely momentous occasion for Mercedes-Benz, which last won the South African Car of the Year in 1987, with the Mercedes-Benz 260E. Porsche last won in 2018 with the Panamera, while Volvo’s XC90 wore the crown in 2016. It certainly wasn’t unexpected. The jury members were full of praise for the A-Class during the test days. “The judges were particularly impressed with its interior comfort, stunning design, innovative technology, terrific road manners and exemplary safety features.

Incredibly, members of the public reached the same conclusion as the highly qualified jury members, who collectively have 584 years of experience in the motor industry. For the first time in the competition’s 34-year history, members of the public could cast a vote via the AutoTrader website – and pick a car that they believed most deserving of the AutoTrader South African Car of the Year title. “After 55 000 consumer votes, I am delighted to reveal that the public vote yielded exactly the same result: they also chose the Mercedes-Benz A-Class,” Mienie revealed. The Porsche Cayenne, which placed second, also scored highly during the evaluation days. “The jury were particularly intrigued by the fact that this is a sports utility vehicle (SUV) which is as impressive to drive as most sports cars.  Furthermore, they commented on the fact that the vehicle is well-engineered, while the driveline is simply faultless,” Van Niekerk explains. The vehicle that came third – the Volvo XC40 – also attracted widespread praise from the judges. This vehicle has notched up award after award – most notably Women’s World Car of the Year and European Car of the Year. The jury members were unanimous in their praise for Volvo’s smallest SUV. Judges particularly liked its minimalistic dashboard design and they commented favourably on the build quality, which is the best in the business.  “Naturally, being a Volvo, the safety features are exemplary too,” Mienie pointed out.
