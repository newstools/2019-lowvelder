 Scores of brave cyclists gathered at 64 Coolmore last week Thursday to participate in the fun MTO Night Ride. At dusk they switched on their bicycle lights and left on the approximately 25-kilometre ride. The route was completed in about one-and-a-half to two hours. MTO Trails offer fun and safety to trail cyclists in the area. The multiple routes are well marked for both running and mountain biking and ideal for group rides and runs. Year-round access permits can be bought for only R500. Non-permit holders may buy an annual subscription (valid for 12 months from the day of purchase) on the day of such events or a once-off permit for R50. Zapper and Snapscan payments accepted and permits can also be bought at Casterbridge Hollow Hotel or the MTO Pull Scar offices just outside White River.
