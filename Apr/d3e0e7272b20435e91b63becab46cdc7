 MBOMBELA – Grade 10 learners from various schools, which Penreach had identified as top performers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects, were invited to participate. Penreach spokesman Candice Peterson explained that they were broken up into teams of four. “They had to create projects using a minimum of resources which creates a solution to problems within their communities.”   Penreach not only assists with the challenge, but plays a constant role in promoting STEM subjects at schools across the area. Penreach’s director of basic education, Sanet Mattheus, said they are privileged to partner with Airlink to give children a once-in-a-lifetime exposure to maths and science. “This will lead to more interest in STEM-related careers. The children have expanded their horizons today.”   In one section UAV Industries taught the learners how to fly drones. In another corner, Appshed.com showed them the stages of robotics and the use of an app. ALSO READ: Gymnasts test themselves during first competition Flight simulators were also present with pilot Zandi Ngobe from Sakhilamva who showed the learners how to use it. Larry Homann showed them how to build their own model aircraft.   Airlink’s executive manager of corporate services, Namhla Tshetu, said the Link project shortlisted 10 children twice a year to broaden learners’ options for careers within STEM.

We introduce them to aviation careers and prepare them for post-matric.  “After the selection camp, the next one will be held in Cape Town. It will offer more exposure into the world of aviation, where they can fly with a pilot. We will also assist them in what choices they are making. We will help them regarding social media and how to apply for bursaries and show them what life is like beyond high school.”
