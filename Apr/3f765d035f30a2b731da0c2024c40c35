 MBOMBELA – The 62-year-old alleged paedophile, who was ordered to move out of the complex he was living in, appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Friday. He indicated that he adhered to the bail condition and that he is now living in a nearby old age home. He was first arrested at the same complex in September last year and faces a charge on two counts of sexual assault of minors as well as a charge of illegal possession of a firearm.

During his appearance on Friday, his legal representative asked that he be accompanied by the investigating officer to the complex so that he may gather the remainder of his belongings from his previous house. The magistrate agreed but warned the accused that under no circumstances is he allowed near the complex without being in the presence of a policeman. The case is postponed to May 17 for the finalising of evidence and the setting of a date on which the trial will commence.
