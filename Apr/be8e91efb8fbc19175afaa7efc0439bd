 Creative Minds Montessori’s Little Community Helpers gave a much-needed donation to Betty’s Haven orphanage last Saturday. According the principal of the school, Tasneem Shaik, it was a humble fund-raising project that started out for jolly tables, chairs and stationery, but soon changed into an opportunity to sponsor a wendy house, folding tables and chairs. Shaik said they heard about the tragedy that happened at the orphanage last year, then decided to help. Betty’s Haven, in Nelsville outside Mbombela, was affected by a devastating fire last November.

Shaik said the fact that it is an orphanage made them want to help. “We knew our kids would be able to relate to the kids and we wanted to donate something that our kids can see. With the blessings of the Almighty and the generous contributions received from parents and supporters, they managed to make the donation possible. We want our kids to learn how to give to those in need from a young age,” she said.

They know of us and we have worked with them before. Our plan is to raise funds with the kids, then hand them over when we are done,” she said.
Shaik said she hopes that these initiatives will encourage others to help the orphanage, since they need all the help they can get.
