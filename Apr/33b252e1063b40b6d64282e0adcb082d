 Emer-G-Med’s Martin Jeffrey gave the following tips for driving during night-time. • Keep windows clean to avoid increased glare and condensation. • Don’t dazzle others – dim your lights when faced with another road user. • Help drivers see you in twilight by turning your headlights on before sunset and keeping them on for an hour after sunrise. • Have your eyes checked regularly for problems which can affect your night vision.
