 A storm was brewing over the city on Thursday.  Most of Beira is still running on generators for businesses and houses. Across the landscape tents were perched as temporary houses and hospitals for those affected by Cyclone Idai which made landfall on March 14, but many more are needed. As I prepare for my journey back to South Africa tomorrow, I leave you with a last few pictures and a video. Tents erected for those who were left homeless. People living in poverty can be seen all over the city. The lighthouse in Beira which survived the cyclone.
