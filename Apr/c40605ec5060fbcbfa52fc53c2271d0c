When we received our back payments in December, we were supposed to also receive all our benefits. But we only received the back payments of our basic salaries. Our overtime and stand-by shifts were never paid. No one came back to us to explain as to why we did not receive our other allowances,” said Mahlalela. He said the only communication they received from the municipal manger was via email.  We want the municipal manager, Neil Diamond, to come and address us in person. We can’t take an explanation via email seriously. Most of our members are illiterate,” added Mahlalela. Police are monitoring the situation.
