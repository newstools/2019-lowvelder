 The Nkomazi Plaza on the N4 Toll Route in Kaapmuiden, Mpumalanga, will be renovated soon so that Trans African Concessions (TRAC) can further improve its service for road users. TRAC said in a press release that the estimated six-week upgrade will commence on April 8 and is expected to be complete by May 17. Most of the construction work will be done after hours and on weekends however, members of the public are urged to take note that slight disruptions may occur. The upgrade, which will be handled by Mpumalanga Civils, will include the expansion of the plaza’s customer waiting area and front office. The latter will be expanded by an additional two service cubicles, which will bring the total number of service cubicles to three.

To ensure that the new space is used adequately, TRAC has also committed to having more office assistants on hand to help road users with queries and services that can only be done at plaza level. This includes account applications, concession applications and e-tag registrations.  Office hours will remain 08:00 – 17:00, but customers will occasionally be assisted outside the main office building where a temporary customer service station will be erected. TRAC thanked their customers in advance for their cooperation during this period and encourages them to contact the TRAC 24-hour helpdesk on 0800 87 22 64 for any further enquiries.
