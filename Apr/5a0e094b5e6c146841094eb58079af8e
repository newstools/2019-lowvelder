 MBOMBELA – The months of March and April are CANSA’s “lead a balanced lifestyle” months. CANSA Lowveld is eager to share some tips on this topic with you to help lower your risk of cancer. What you can do
Eat vegetables, fruits, legumes, beans, pulses and whole grains that contain nutrients including vitamins, minerals, plant chemicals and fibre. Aim to eat up to 5-7 portions of non-starchy vegetables and fruits in season every day where possible. Include whole grains and minimally processed grains as a source of fibre. Dry beans, soya beans and other legumes/lentils are high in fibre & isoflavones. Try to include them in meals 3-4 times a week. ALSO READ: CANSA launches new support group  What might put you at risk
Eating habits can influence body weight, which in turn can affect your risk of developing cancer. Foods that are high in kilojoules (energy) like sweets, chocolates, cakes, biscuits, pastries, desserts, crisps are also high in sugar and/or fat and when eaten more often can lead to weight gain. Beverages sweetened with sugar and alcoholic drinks high in kilojoules can lead to weight gain. Limit the amount of fast foods & processed foods high in fat (fried), sugar and refined starches (like white bread). What is a definite no-no
Eating large amounts of processed meat and too much red meat can increase your risk for getting cancer. The cooking process when preparing meat may form chemicals that increase cancer risk, like when braaiing or deep frying. Eating large amounts of foods that have been preserved/cured using a lot of salt is also not healthy. Avoid alcoholic drinks. ALSO READ: Hope picnic in aid for cancer
