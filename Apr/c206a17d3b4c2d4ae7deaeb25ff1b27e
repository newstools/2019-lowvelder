 Retha Burger (71) said she still cannot believe how wonderful the doctors at the local hospital were to her. “It all started when I decided to drop off someone in town and the next thing I woke up in hospital. I really do not remember what happened on that day, but it was great to find myself in the hands of the staff at Rob Ferreira. They would sing beautiful songs in the corridors and they were kind to me,” she said.

I stayed in ICU for a few days and when I was better I went to a general ward. Everything was fantastic and I was well cared for. They later sent me home and I went back for check-ups. At some point my head got swollen but when I went back they simply drained what they needed to and their service has never changed,” she said.
