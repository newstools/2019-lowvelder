The match failed to produce a winner in the regulation time, so had to be decided via the penalty shoot-out. Four schools within the Barberton Department of Education circuit competed in the tournament. They were KaMhola, Emjindini, Chief Funwako and Barberton Secondary School. Ligwalagwala FM and Nelspruit Auto’s soccer teams played as curtain-raisers before the final. Ligwalagwala won 5-2. Willie “Da Voice” Qwabe, the tournament initiator, said the main aim was to unite young people and give them a break to showcase their talent. Growing up in the dusty streets of Barberton was challenging, but I had to find a way to stay focused and remain grounded. Besides the love, care and guidance of my grandparents, playing soccer kept me from illegal activities. I have decided to bring hope and restore human dignity to the youth of Emjindini through sports. It is a known fact that Barberton is one of the townships in the Lowveld with the highest number of young people involved in drugs, alcohol abuse and crime,” he said. Qwabe works at Ligwalagwala FM as a voice-over artist. The winning team received a brand-new soccer kit and gold medals. Qwabe thanked the community of Emjindini, sponsors and all stakeholders who played an instrumental role in making the tournament a success. He said the tourney will henceforth be an annual one.
