 MBOMBELA – This follows the airport’s new partnership with Cape Town Air Access (CTAA). The two announced last week that they have signed a cooperation agreement. CTAA is to assist KMI Airport in developing its air route network while promoting the airport to an international market. It is set to improve connectivity between Cape Town and Mbombela, growing tourism between the regions, and improving the accessibility of Mbombela. The privately-owned KMI Airport is the largest thatch-constructed airport in the world, and has welcomed more than 3 million passengers since it began operations in October 2002.

Wesgro, the official tourism, trade and investment promotion agency for Cape Town and the Western Cape, said the partnership provides the opportunity to package a popular Cape Town to Kruger National Park (via the Garden Route) itinerary, which is an attractive proposition for international visitors. “The cooperation agreement allows for tourism entities to work together and provide visitors with a rich offering,” said Tim Harris, Wesgro CEO. “As we continue to grow air connectivity into the Western Cape, we want to share the spirit of collaboration embodied in the CTAA project which has proven to be the foundation for success in the region.” Nel added that Wesgro’s reputation for achieving success with their projects precedes them. “With their established contacts in the aviation industry, the agreement opens an abundance of opportunities for us.” ALSO READ: “The South Africa we hope for” – Dr Mathews Phosa
