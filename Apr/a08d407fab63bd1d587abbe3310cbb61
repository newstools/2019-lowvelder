Rangers on foot, accompanied by members of the KNP Airwing flew over the area that was described by the family but due to failing light, could not locate the body. The team resumed the search on Thursday morning, with further information provided after four of the deceased’s alleged accomplices, who were arrested during the previous evening by the Komatipoort SAPS. During this search, which was boosted with a further compliment of Field Rangers, the remains of a body was discovered. Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants. Skukuza police were notified immediately and are currently busy with further investigations into the incident.

It is very sad to see the daughters of the diseased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains.” The four arrested individuals are in custody and will appear in court in due course.
