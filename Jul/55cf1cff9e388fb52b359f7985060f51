 Six pilots attended this first round with some seriously enthusiastic spectators. The aim for this round was for pilots to familiarise themselves with the workshop surroundings and to decide on whether more similar events should be organised in future. Everyone enjoyed themselves and the RC pilots demonstrated some spectacular skills. Crashes and repairs were inevitable, but the modellers made quick work of it to again join the flight line.

One obviously has to acquire some flying skills before trying your hand in the indoor scene, but it can be done. Start by joining the Lomac club.  The winners of the night were Rob Snow for “applying the most glue” and Theuns Botha for the “most daring flight routine”. The next event will be held in September. Enquiries: www.lomac.co.za.
