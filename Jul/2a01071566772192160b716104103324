 MPUMALANGA –  Former Witbank Municipality Internal Sports Club (WMISC) manager, Lida Potgieter (62), was held in custody last week Friday by the Emalahleni Regional Court. This after failing to comply with her bail conditions following an appeal. During her tenure at WMISC, between January 2004 and July 2009, municipality employees contributed member fees which were deducted from their salaries. Once the sum grew, Potgieter initiated an in-house lending scheme to which employees contributed in the belief that more investments would increase their earnings. The Hawks were on her heels after the scheme collapsed.

In 2015, a case was registered and a probe into her dealings was launched by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigating Unit. She was arrested and faced 737 fraud charges before being sentenced to six years’ imprisonment in 2015. Potgieter lodged an appeal against the court’s judgement and was released on R 10 000 bail.
