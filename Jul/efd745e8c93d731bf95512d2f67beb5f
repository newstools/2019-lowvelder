 An important mass meeting of all the tourism industry players will be held on Friday from 10:00 to 12:00 at Church Unlimited in Mbombela. During the meeting they will finalise their own “State of Tourism Report” which will be handed over to the minister of tourism next week. Some of the issues that will be discussed are: lack of leadership, unreliable service delivery, protests, unsafe conditions, unsafe roads, the looming water crisis, small town looking terrible and bad publicity. Other points that that will be on the table are dilapidated public attractions, the terrible situation of Pilgrim’s Rest, the uncertainty around the World Heritage Site’s development, lack of development opportunity, corruption, lack of proper funding for tourism marketing, and countless mining applications in tourism areas.   There will be no costs for the meeting and all industry players are invited. RSVP to tourism@klcbt.co.za
