 WHITE RIVER – About 30 learners attended the extra classes that were presented by former Rob Ferreira learner, Similo Siyenga, at his alma mater last week. Siyenga matriculated last year and is currently a student of civil engineering at the University of Pretoria. Growing up in Matsulu, Siyenga realised that if it had not been for the extra classes he had attended, he would have not been able to achieve the marks to go to university, and decided he wanted to give back by providing extra classes like the ones he had been given.
