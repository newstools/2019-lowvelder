 MBOMBELA – All interested in history and heritage are welcome to join Mpumalanga Heritage on its visit to the historic site of Botshabelo and Fort Merensky outside Middelburg on Saturday July 13. Though this old Berlin mission station, once a pristine museum complex, has suffered some neglect over the past years, some emergency restoration has recently been done. The old church building still stands to this day.

Join us on an important exploration of one of the most endangered heritage sites in South Africa. The visit will also serve as an investigation into the future of the adjacent Fort Merensky, which currently is the property of HASA (previously the Foundation Simon van der Stel). The school building harks back to an era which holds memories for many. This site and historic structure needs to be carried over to a relevant institution or government department. The outing will be in conjunction with the recently established Middelburg Heritage Association. To offer space in your vehicle or if you need a seat, please contact Robin Bell on 082-693-0114. We would like to put as many people in as few as possible cars to share the costs.
