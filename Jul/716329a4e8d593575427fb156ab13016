 The 17-year-old is set to make his mark in local rugby and wishes to play professionally after school. He said he is proud to have been selected, considering that the past few months have been challenging, with him mourning his late father, Joseph, who died in an accident last December. It was not an easy year for me as I had to deal with my father’s passing. However, over and above that I needed to take this step in my life because I understood where my strengths lay. I think these opportunities will allow room for personal growth and to sharpen my skills. I’m glad that the Pumas saw something in me during the tournaments that took place.

I promise to perform to the best of my abilities and put the province on the map,” he said.
