 About 7 500 visitors attended this year’s show, which was slightly down on last year, according to CMC’s organiser, Rusty Thorns. He added that the date clash with a classic car show at the Expo Centre had affected attendance. Unfortunately, there was no support for the show from the major motorcycle distributors this year and the number of classic and customised motorcycles on display was smaller than previous years.  However, there were many stalls selling motorcycle-related gear and components, such as exhaust systems and the like. It is difficult to understand why the major brands failed to take up the opportunity of having a presence at a well-supported and well-organised event such as the 1 000 Bike Show, which has been staged since 1985.

There was not even a dedicated Triumph stand this year, whereas in the past it had been one of the biggest displays at this event, with classic and new models on show. The number of motorcycle on show may have been disappointing, but there was plenty of quality on display. There was also a number of unusual exhibits including a rare Italian Volugrafo Bimbo minicar, a trike powered by a turbocharged BMW V8 engine and a Moto Guzzi load carrier.  Gary van Jaarsveld’s immaculate Kawasaki Z900 was adjudged Best on Show, while the women judges favoured William Viljoen’s 1960 BSA Gold Star. ALSO READ: The mother of biking in the Lowveld
