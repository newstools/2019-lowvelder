The vehicle allegedly made a U-turn on the N4 towards Mozambique just before the Nkomazi Toll Gate, causing the accident, and the driver afterwards allegedly fled the scene. A case of culpable homicide has since been investigated.  Ngomane said that the family needed closure, as the driver had not been arrested. “Joseph was like a brother to me. I heard the driver has two identities, one for South Africa and the other for Swaziland and is believed to be residing in the latter. We will not rest until we have had closure regarding his death.” ALSO READ: Law enforces set to reappear in court A close friend of the deceased stated that they were still confused as to why the police had not arrested the driver yet. “I have seen other police cases between the two countries leading to cross-border arrests, and here we are still waiting for answers as to why this driver has not been caught.” The police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi was not reachable for comment at the time of going to print.
