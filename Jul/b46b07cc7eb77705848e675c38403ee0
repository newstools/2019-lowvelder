The Ster-Kinekor Cine Prestige at iâ€™langa Mall is definitely one to consider when comfort is important to you. As you walk in you see a beautiful room with a bar and chairs where you can order food, alcoholic beverages or popcorn and other snacks. You can either choose to sit there and enjoy or you can order and enter the movie and relax while waiting for the waiters to bring everything to you inside the movie.  There are two types of chairs. If you like your space then you can choose to sit in a couple of individual chairs and if you would like to cuddle up and spark the romance you can choose to sit with your loved one in a love seat. All the chairs are fully equipped with enough space to stretch out and pass without disturbing fellow movie goers.  The red leather couch is fully electric and can adjust into a fully laying down position for you to enjoy your movie in the most comfortable position you choose to be in. The cup holders are ice cold as if they are refrigerated leaving your drink cold through the whole movie.  With not worrying about the constant struggle for space one can actually enjoy the movie. Whether you go 2D or 3D with things flying right into your face the big screen and big theatre has more than enough space and comfort to accommodate everyone. It is truly an experience everyone should try at least once in their life time. You will never see a normal movie experience the same after Cine Prestige ever again.
