On Sunday, police exhumed three bodies, following the discovery of the first two last week and two weeks ago respectively. According to Bhembe, “It did not seem as if the accused had the same modus operandi in the alleged killings. The police arrested the suspect on July 3 after he was handed over to police by his own mother three days later.” The case was postponed until July 19 for a bail application. It is not clear whether the state would oppose bail.
