 BARBERTON – Bernard Sanderson is looking for his 14-year-old daughter, Tanica, who disappeared from home with friends on June 29. According to Bernard, the teenager and a group of friends left home to attend an event in either Ngodini or Lekazi over the school holidays. He said that he does not recall the clothing she wore at the time of her disappearance, but that she is approximately 1,4 metres tall, wears earrings in both ears and that her phone is still active. The distraught father has since opened a missing persons case with the Barberton police and is desperate to have her returned home unharmed.
