 With local chef, Pieter Malan, she is the second Lowvelder to feature on the new Kokkedoor series to hail from the Lowveld. The much anticipated season starts on Thursday at 20:00 on kykNET. Wilding invented a recipe just for Lowvelders. You can bake this recipe in a standard 23cm cake tin or in individual little silicone moulds with pretty shapes. These little treats are perfect for this time of year when citrus is in abundance here in the Lowveld. You will need:
• 4 clementines
• 2 cinnamon sticks
• 6 cardamom pods – crushed
• 8 whole cloves
• 6 whole eggs
• 1 tsp vanilla extract
• 150g light brown sugar
• 75g caster sugar
• 1 tsp gluten-free baking powder*
• 300g ground almonds
• 1 pink grapefruit – juiced
• 1 cup icing sugar – sifted
• Sprigs of fresh thyme.  Place the whole clementines (skin on) in a small saucepan then cover them with cold tap water. Add the cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods and whole cloves to the water and bring to a boil. Once the water is at a rolling boil, turn the heat down to its lowest, cover with a lid and simmer the clementines for one hour. Preheat the oven to 180° and prepare a 23cm baking tin by spraying it with Spray & Cook, and line the bottom with a layer of grease-proof baking paper. Remove the whole clementines from the water and let them cool slightly. Place them in a blender or food processor (skin and all) until smooth. Place the eggs, vanilla extract and sugars in a metal or glass bowl over a pot of simmering water, and whisk with a hand whisk until mixture is fluffy and mousse-like. Remove from the heat and add the puree, almonds and baking powder and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the tin and place your cake in the oven. Bake the cake for 30 min at 180°, then turn the heat down to 160° and bake for another 35 min, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for about 20 min, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the icing combine the grapefruit juice and the icing sugar and whisk till smooth. Pour these liberally over the cake and decorate with fresh thyme. *You can also use regular baking powder in this recipe, but please note that it won’t be gluten-free any longer.
