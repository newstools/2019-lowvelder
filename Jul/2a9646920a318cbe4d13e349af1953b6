 As South Africa rapidly shifts toward a digital economy, the labour market and education system need swift transformation to keep up with demand. An organisation that is championing this shift is the Good Work Foundation (GWF), which is re-imagining education in rural South Africa. GWF is launching its Dumphries Digital Learning Campus (DDLC), the fifth of six digital learning campuses educating, upskilling and creating jobs for rural, and often marginalised, communities in Mpumalanga. The launch will be done on Friday at Dumphries Digital Learning Campus (DDLC), located close to the Sabi Sand Game Reserve in Dumphries B village. Inspired by the 2030 National Development Plan and endorsed by the Mpumalanga Department of Education, each of the digital learning campuses is a public-private partnership that supports rural South Africans to be able to walk with more confidence into a digital future.

This organisation is one of the few NGOs in South Africa focusing on digital learning opportunities for young adults and learners living in rural communities. GWF’s adult learning programmes aim to create “digital citizens” capable of starting their own businesses, being successful at university, and entering the digital marketplace. The on-campus enterprise provides not only potential employment opportunities for young people completing the courses, but revenue for the foundation. The profits help contribute to the programme for young school learners, focusing on self-organised learning environments supported by “edtech”. ALSO READ: Barberton Gateway learners excel
