 South African National Parks (SANParks) has announced National Parks Week whereby South Africans can enter all national parks for free. This, of course, includes the Kruger National Park. According to a SANParks press release, this year it is pleased to announce that it has extended the week to include weekends, heeding the request from South Africans who do not have time to visit national parks during the week. This year SANParks is even more excited to host SA National Parks Week as the country celebrates 25 years of democracy as a nation.

Since we started the programme in 2006, some 438 361 South Africans have been afforded the opportunity to enter national parks, and we want to see these numbers grow,” the press release says. “It’s important for South Africans to visit and know the importance of national parks. They act as spaces to practise sustainable conservation, as spaces that preserve and celebrate our culture and heritage, and we now see national parks playing the critical role of empowering communities living adjacent to parks through job creation and we continue to explore ways of creating business opportunities particularly for small business owners,” says SANParks chief executive officer, Fundisile Mketeni.
