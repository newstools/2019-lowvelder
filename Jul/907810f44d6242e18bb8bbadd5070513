 If sports is your thing, then this is year’s Citybug challenge is for you. Not only will you have the opportunity to showcase your skill, but also to make a difference. According to Citybug’s Marthinus de Bruin, they decided to donate the money to the school for upgrades to the school hall, “because we wish to make a lasting impact”.  The first event will be the rowing challenge. This consists of a 500-metre challenge at 08:00, a 1 000-metre challenge at 09:00, a 2 000-metre challenge at 10:00 and a 3 000-metre challenge at 11:00. De Bruin explained that prize money will be awarded depending on how far you row. For example the winner of the 500-metre challenge will receive R500.

The first will be an individual gymnastics challenge at 08:30, the second an individual powerlifting event at 09:30 and the third a strongman event at 10:30 that you can enter as an individual or in teams of four.  This will all be a build-up for the main event, which will happen at 12:00. For this event you can either enter as an individual or teams of four to six people. It starts out with 5 000-metre rowing, which can be completed by the whole team or by an individual. This is followed by a 400-metre run that the whole team needs to take part in. The run will be followed up by 200 burpees that can be divided between the members of the team. The challenge ends with 200 single skipping – meaning 200 jump rope skips between every two people in the team. ALSO READ: Murph Challenge: Have you got what it takes?
