One of the group, identified as 17-yearold Delani Nkosi, purportedly accused Mpendulo of having a dalliance with his girlfriend. Delani allegedly produced a knife. Jeqe intervened in the altercation. He was stabbed in the upper right thigh. Delani also allegedly stabbed Siphesihle in the back before fleeing the scene. The pupils tried helping Yolisa to receive assistance for his injury at Barberton General Hospital, which is within walking distance from the school.

Delani was arrested by police the following day. He appeared in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court yesterday under the supervision of a probation officer and was to be taken to a place of safety. Sithole has denounced the act and sent his condolences to the family. “Learners must not force their way out of the school even during break times. Parents should be sensitised that children should not leave the premises, because the school has a tuck shop and other amenities. This is primarily to ensure that they are in a safe environment.”
