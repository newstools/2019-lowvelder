Everybody looked stunning and the teachers really added to making our night one to remember, by joining us on the dance floor. I could not have asked for a better way to finish off my matric year with the class of 2019,” Ashleigh Smyth said. Vidaan Singh agreed with her wholeheartedly.    “The matric dance is definitely one of the highlights of our school career. A lot of effort goes into ensuring that you make an impressionable appearance on the red carpet, which was only complimented by the glamour of the event.
