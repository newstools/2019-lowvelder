 MBOMBELA – To celebrate in style, the University of Johannesburg’s choir will perform. This choir was crowned as world champions at the World Choir Games in Pretoria last year. The group took gold in both the categories it competed in with 85 per cent for mixed choirs (Western music repertoire), and in folk music a cappella it received a whopping 95 per cent score.  As usual, the world-famous conductor Richard Cock will be in charge of the programme as well as the mass choir items. This year you can look forward to not only traditional choral music, but also a bit of praise and worship. The local choirs to perform will be the Laudate Choir, which won silver at the abovementioned choir games last year and also performed at Sappi Mother’s Day this year, as well as the senior choir from Laerskool Laeveld.  This annual event will be held at the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk in Belladonna Street. Tickets for the event costs R100 per person and R80 for primary school children and pensioners. Tickets can be bought at both the church and Mopani Pharmacy. Enquiries: 013-741-1455.
