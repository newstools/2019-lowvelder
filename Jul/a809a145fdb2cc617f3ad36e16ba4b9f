The footage also showed that Mienkie allegedly slapped Van Rooyen. “Zander and Earle and their friends went outside to the parking area where the argument allegedly continued. What is claimed to have happened was Zander was fighting with Earle and Van Rooyen intervened to help him. Zander apparently lunged for Van Rooyen, who then allegedly punched him back in an alleged defense. Zander fell down and hit his head.” The police confirmed that Earle had opened an attempted murder case against Zander and Van Rooyen had opened an assault case against Mienkie.
