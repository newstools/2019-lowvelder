 MBOMBELA – Mariolise le Roux from Innibos said, as a way of giving back to the community, they started an initiative by creating Olla the Elephant for the parade. Karin Erasmus from Pro-Life Pet Rescue and Liza Pienaar, chairman of Nelspruit SPCA, collected the products that were donated on Monday at the Innibos offices. “Olla is made of steel and is a big elephant.We asked the community to assist by donating dog and cat food which we then decided to give to the two organisations. We love giving back and this year we chose them. Next year we will choose a different organisation. We give back to people in the community and animal organisations,” she said. Le Roux said that SPCA and Pro-Life Pet Rescue are in need of all the assistance they can get. The community can also give back by going to the organisations and assisting. Those who would like to help them can contact Innibos or the organisations.
