 The Toyota Hilux sealed the second quarter of 2019 with its highest ever recorded monthly sales total in South Africa.
The June total of 4 770 is 35 units more than the previous highest total of 4 335, recorded in 2011. Of the Hilux models sold last month, 1 885 were double cabs, 1 648 Xtra cabs and 1 237 single cabs. Senior vice president of sales and marketing at Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM), Calvyn Hamman, said, “There are not many locally-manufactured vehicles that can claim the iconic status that Hilux has achieved in South Africa. Not only has the Hilux sold more than 1 million units to date (locally), it continues to be a sales sensation even in the trying economic climate we are experiencing.” According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), the aggregate domestic sales at 45 939 units showed a decline of 724 units or 1,6% from the 46 663 vehicles sold in June last year.

Despite the local economy’s timorous state, Toyota sales have once again bucked the trend in June, posting an increase of 385 units compared to the same month in 2018. Other than Hilux, last month’s star performers included Fortuner (1 410), Quantum Taxi and Van (1 301), Corolla Quest (745), Etios (659) and RAV4 (653). TSAM’s luxury brand, Lexus, was just five units shy of posting 100 sales, courtesy of 27 ES, 21 UX and 20 NX models sold last month. On the truck front, Hino amassed a total of 319 sales. The 500-series achieved a commendable market share of 23,9% in the HCV segment while the 300-series recorded 18,7% in the MCV segment.”We’re delighted with the strong sales we had last month. Clearly, being a tried and trusted brand is a strong purchasing factor in the current economy. However, we owe our sales success to the various Toyota, Hino and Lexus ambassadors. It’s the cumulative result of all the hard work and dedication of our dealers, our manufacturing division, distribution centres as well as sales and marketing teams.
