I loved watching all the trees and animals. It is all very different from my culture.”   DAY 4 Posted by Miloslav Bouška on Monday, 15 July 2019 It was not only the ladies who were excited. Mister Deaf Taiwan, Huang Tsan-Hui, said it was a privilege to learn so much about the animals and to experience nature in such a beautiful way. “It is very different than what I am used to. It is like two seasons in one day here, but we also got to see the most beautiful sunset.”
