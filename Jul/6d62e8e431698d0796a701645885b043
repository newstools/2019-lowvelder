 Also wonderful to see were more spectators than race cars. The stands were well packed before the races even started. Perhaps it is an ode to the revival of the oval. It was also the day a Rebellion turned up at the track – yes, 10 Rebel-class cars. And that made for spectacular racing! With so many cars on the track, there were various battles being fought throughout the grid and right to the end of each heat.  A pity we do not have ten cars of every class in every heat. It would keep spectators on the edge of their camp chairs and out from under their umbrellas. This is what is needed to take the sport to the next level.

Nic de Witt, owner of these Rebel cars, mentor and active promoter of the sport, is to be thanked for bringing the Rebels over. Hopefully this will become a regular feature at Nelspruit’s track.  The Rookie class had four competitors, and as most drivers were tip-toeing around the track, Hanneke Brits used this to her advantage and gently slipped through the traffic to claim top spot for the day. The 1660s were as always hot and bothered, with Dean Wahlstrand pulling a couple of strange and somewhat wild moves down the back straight – veering left, then right, to drift into and through the corners.  Reckless – dangerous – I am not sure, this is for the COC to decide. Melinda, who races in the 2-litre class, had a couple of oopsies. She seem to struggle a little, keeping the Beetle on track through the corners. Her fan club loves her to bits though, despite these mistakes.  In the Hotrod class, competition was tight and fast with Chris Moolman ruling the roost and Dave Keast in his bakkie in second spot. The next event will be on August 3 – do not miss it!
