 MBOMBELA – President Cyril Ramaphosa reportedly signed the proclamation giving the state’s SIU the go-ahead to probe the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the Independent Development Trust (IDT) for maladministration. It was gazetted last Friday. The SIU was established by the president and conducts investigations at his request, and reports to him on the outcomes.  Transactions to be investigated include the construction and acquisition of land for the Mpumalanga High Court, as well as the construction of the Limpopo High Court, the Plettenberg Bay Magistrate’s Court, the Booysens Magistrate’s Court, the Richards Bay Magistrate’s Court and the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court.
