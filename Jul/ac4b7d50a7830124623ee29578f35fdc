After all the play, they were also treated to an ice cream at Milky Lane.  “For many of these children, it is the first time they have visited a mall and their faces just lit up when they walked in here,” Penreach spokesman Candice Peterson said. One of the school’s teachers, Sarah Magane, accompanied the children to the mall and said she was thankful for organisation’s support of the school.
