 MBOMBELA – According to Capt Zandile Gqawa, fraudsters use different modus operandi. In some cases, a fraudster posts an advertisement on social media pretending to be selling a car. The victim is told to deposit money into a bank account or to send it through Money Market before the car can be delivered. The fraudster will withdraw the money and disappear without delivering the vehicle. In other cases, the fraudster pretends to be calling from a bank. They inform the victim that their account has been hacked.
They request the victim confirm their personal details and to provide their bank account’s PIN. The fraudster then obtains access to the victim’s account and withdraws money. ALSO READ: MTPA labour dispute resolved
In other cases the fraudster will pretend to be a police officer. They call the victims and inform them that their friend or relative has been arrested and they need bail money. The victims are told to send the money through Money Market. In other cases, fraudsters post an advertisement that they are a company dealing in personal loans, their interest rates are very low and that they also cater for blacklisted people. The victim is told to deposit a certain amount of money before the loan can be processed. The victim will do so and never receive the cash loan.

The banks will never request your PIN. Contact your nearest branch before furnishing your personal details over the phone. Approach a reputable cash loan company if you need a loan.” Nelspruit SAPS can be contacted on 013-759-1008 or 086-001-0111.
