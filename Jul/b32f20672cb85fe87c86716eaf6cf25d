 Hijackings and armed robberies are still priority crimes on South African roads. With the safety and well-being of the N4 Toll Route’s road users a priority for TRAC, it urges members of the public to take precautions against becoming victims of these crimes. TRAC encourages road users to take responsibility for their own safety, by applying the following anti-crime safety tips when travelling on our route: * Plan your trip and let someone know the expected time of your arrival.
* Avoid driving with your windows open and keep the doors locked. Keep valuables out of sight.
* Avoid distractions while driving, such as using a cellphone.
* Always check the rear-view mirror to see if you are being followed. If you suspect you are being followed, drive to your nearest police station or a busy public area.
* Never stop on the highway, even near toll plazas. Stationary vehicles are extremely vulnerable to criminal elements.
* Do not stop on the side of the road for a toilet break.
* Be vigilant when drawing money at ATMs. Do not accept help from strangers.
* Pay your toll fees at the toll plazas only. Ignore anyone who approaches you and indicates that they are accepting toll fees on behalf of TRAC.
* Do not stop for suspicious law enforcement vehicles. Should you be tailed by a law enforcement vehicle it is permissible for you as a driver to opt to stop at a public area, such as a filling or police station.
* If you need to stop due to an emergency, try to do so only at designated facilities such as filling or police stations.
* Be vigilant against opportunistic criminal elements that may create a breakdown situation to force you to stop on the side of the road and attack you.
* Ensure your car is in good working condition. A well-maintained car is less likely to break down and leave you vulnerable.
* Should your vehicle have mechanical or maintenance problems, especially at night, avoid getting out of the vehicle to inspect it. Call or text TRAC’s 24-hour Helpdesk immediately on 0800 87 22 64/082 881 4444 for prompt roadside assistance. When contacting the Helpdesk, you will be required to give your name, contact information, vehicle type, registration number and your exact location (use the nearest Blue Marker board located every 200 metres on the side of the N4 Toll Route).

* Do not give anyone a lift, under any circumstances.
