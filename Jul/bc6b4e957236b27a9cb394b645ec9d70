 “With the new, well-located and beautiful dealership right next to Garden City Motors in Riverside, we are ready to introduce many locals to the quality and affordability of Haval,” said sales manager Chris Gryvenstein. Haval is the leading SUV brand in China and recently achieved a local monthly sales record of 960 units (combined for bakkies and SUVs).  With 53 dealerships in South Africa, and a Gold rating in the National Automobile Dealer Satisfaction Index (NADA DSI), the brand has stated its intention to become one not to be ignored.

The latter will take a number of motoring and lifestyle journalists across Mpumalanga and eventually back to White River where they will make a donation to Child Welfare before everyone going their various, merry ways again.  The trip will of course include some hardcore test-driving to expose all involved to the brand’s on- and off-road prowess. Haval Motors’ PR and marketing executive Vaughn Swanepoel, also on hand at the event, used the opportunity to facilitate the delivery of two vehicles to new and excited local owners.  If you are in the market for an affordable mode of transport – bakkie, SUV or small hatch, it would be wise to visit the dealership sooner rather than later!
