 Albie van de Venter was inducted as White River Rotary Club president during a function at the White River Golf Club last week. He took over the reins from Renate Bowers, who is now appointed as assistant governor for Rotary District 9400. Albie also introduced his board members and their portfolios for his term of service. They are Ian Donaldson (membership), Adrian Newton (treasurer), Renate Bowers (fun and fundraising), Debbie van Rooyen (executive secretary), Gavin Sinclair (club service), Brian Hyson (community service), Judy Pott (youth service) and Frances Hyson (Rotary Foundation). At the first weekly Rotary meeting Van de Venter quoted the words of Giuseppe di Lampedusa, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change”, as a challenge for the new Rotary year. He said if the members want the club to continue to be a successful, happy one in a rapidly changing world, they will have to take a close look at how they do things and ask themselves what changes need to be brought about to move with the times.
