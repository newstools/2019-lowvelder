 This led to her entry in the International Watermedia Festival, where she was one of 14 contestants from 26 countries to be acknowledged for her art. The prize-giving for the International Watercolor Society of South Africa’s first International Watermedia Festival, “Colors of the Rainbow Nation”, was held on September 3 in Cape Town.  Williams received one of the honorary mention awards. “It was mind-blowing for me,” she says. “I used to do art at school, but except for my job as a graphic designer I have not done it for about 20 years.

My fiancé pointed to a Bob Marley drawing I did years ago and told me that I am just as good. That is when I decided to start again.” She joined the International Watercolor Society of South Africa. According to the competition rules, contestants could enter two artworks, of which only one would have the opportunity to be chosen as a winner. The piece had to be modelled after a photo that the artist had taken.  “I entered only one piece, a leopard called Basile that I took a photo of near Sabie Sands.” Williams focuses mainly on wildlife, and does art pieces not only with watercolour but also with pastels, graphite and oil-based paints.
“It was quite daunting when I started to focus on art more seriously. I didn’t know how the art world works and it is quite difficult to find places to exhibit your art.” That, however, did not slow her down. Her works are currently being showcased at the Kruger Gallery at Casterbridge as well as the Warren Cary Wildlife Gallery in Hoedspruit. “I always loved doing art and I am so excited that I get to do it again.” ALSO READ: Community support imperative to combat crime, according to SAPS
