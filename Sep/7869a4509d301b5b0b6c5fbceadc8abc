 Johnny Kerswill, of Hi-Tech Security, confirmed that after one-and-a-half years of development, they will start using a facial recognition application to fight crime. “This WhatsApp network is the only one in the world where a photo can be sent to a localised database, and within seconds the sender will receive an updated profile on the suspect.”  Artificial intelligence can complete tasks with a precision and speed unmatched by humans, and will drastically improve the predictability, accuracy, and efficiency of social management and crime-fighting. Kerswill gave an example where they were busy doing a demonstration for a client in Gauteng.  “We had set up the camera at a well known jewellery store, and during the demonstration the camera picked up a man walking past the shop. Within seconds I received the message that this man was a wanted criminal in Mbombela. We received his photo six years ago when he was implicated in a crime here.” READ ALSO: Hi-Tech sold to listed company for millions  The Incident Management Centre (IMC) – a revolutionary surveillance solution – is part of an integrated security solution with an events-driven real-time facial recognition, licence plate identification, and retail analytics and integration ability. Modern security solutions have now evolved into physical security measures supporting technology security, unlike the past where technology security measures supported physical security.

The IMC license plate recognition solution saves and recalls license plate numbers, images of vehicles, date and timestamps and location of each vehicle. Using patented AxxonSoft technology, “we are able to perform fast database searches based on speed range, time frames or any of the other information captured. This data can be used to compile various analytics and report to gain insights into traffic in and out of an environment,” according to Kerswill.  • Tracking and search purposes: A vast network of surveillance cameras can find any vehicle.
• Real-time tracking allows you to find the location of a vehicle where it is at that moment, not where it was three hours ago
• Optimisation: License plate recognition also allows for features like optimisation of traffic flow, automatic weighing of trucks and automatic logging for railways.
Facial recognition
The real-world application of facial recognition is a powerful tool to have in your business surveillance arsenal. It provides peace of mind to business, governments and the general population through the following:
• Immediate detection and reporting of problems when a recognised face enters a perimeter
• Emergency personnel can be sent to the scene of a crime or accident within seconds
• Offenders can be tracked down across multiple video surveillance cameras and properties which, in turn, aids arrests
• Prevention of crimes, acts of terror and accidents
• Crowd management and security in public places such as stadium, airports, etc.
• Access control and investigation.
