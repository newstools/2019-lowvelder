 They are all a part of Boven Reboot – an initiative that aims to restore the town to its former glory.
According to one of the residents, Nicolene Hogg, the next phase is to replant grass on the front section of the small garden at the library. Ishmael Abdullah, Emakhazeni Local Municipality’s unit manager, and his team helped with preparations for the work by removing the dead grass and stones which allowed the residents to lay fertiliser and do the planting over the weekend. The plants, fertiliser, grass and trees were all donated by residents themselves, as well as Aloes Country Inn. Besides revamping the library garden, the residents also recently repainted the Goodman building, as it is locally known.

We want to continue to tackle eyesores and generally improve the face of the town,” Hogg said. ”  Boven has so much potential and natural beauty and we hope that making the town look good again will and attract tourists which will have a positive effect on the local economy. We are also keen for more people to join in these initiatives and that in future we will be able to raise funds, as right now, we are completely reliant on ourselves. The more hands we have to help, the more can get done faster.” ALSO READ: Artist recognised for her remarkable talent
