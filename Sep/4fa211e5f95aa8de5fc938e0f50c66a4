 Just because you are office bound, or can’t afford to go to the Kruger National Park, does not mean  you have to miss out on exciting sightings. With SANParks’ three live streaming webcams, the wildlife can come to you!  The camera near the Orpen waterhole was installed in 2004, and takes a photo every 30 seconds, which means you don’t ever have to miss out on any waterhole action. It became so popular that a second camera had to be installed. This second webcamera was placed on the southeast side of the Satara camp in 2006, and provides excellent gameviewing moments.  What is so interesting about the second cam is that it has a wireless connection to the SANParks network. This means it can be controlled via remote to pan, zoom or even tilt.  It must be noted that viewing live video streams of these webcams require a lot of bandwidth. It also need a high-speed Internet connection.
