This year only 15 awards will be given. “After an extensive adjudication process the finalists and winners are selected. The process includes telephonic surveys with clients and suppliers of the business, followed by evaluation of their financial growth and corporate social investment. The specialist categories are adjudicated by panels of experts in those fields. There are no personal interviews with competitors and no public voting system. “We choose the best business on all levels. Awards are given based on merit, not popularity or perception of success,” she said.
