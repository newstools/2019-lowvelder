 National Braai Day is here, and although the mercury dropped considerably yesterday, smoke and aromas from braais are sure to start filling the air soon. Here are some of the social no-no’s according to a recent study, that we are guilty of at a classic “bring and braai.” • 87% are unsure of exactly what food to bring along. Should it be meat only or meat and drinks or meat and salad? According to Jan Braai, guests need to bring their own meat and drinks, and it’s always good manners to arrive with a light snack, flowers or chocolate to thank the host. • 52% believe it’s fine to share the meat among the guests, but everyone should ideally eat their own meat. • 45% said waiting 2 to 4 hours for the meal to be served is acceptable, but Jan Braai begs to differ. “The only time it’s acceptable to serve food more than two hours after arrival is if the communal watching of a game of sport of national importance is part of the braai, and that is the cause for the delay in getting meat onto the grid, but the general rule of thumb is between 1 to 2 hours.” • 69% felt it customary to light the fire together, which is ideal, provided that guests arrive on time! • There is also confusion as to who should braai the meat. Three out of ten said it should be a team effort, but proper braai etiquette would be for the host to braai the meat and to accept assistance only if offered. • Most respondents polled agreed on potato salad, green salad, garlic bread and roosterkoek as must-have sides, but these should ideally be coordinated by the host. • 85% said that a separate grid should be provided for vegetarian, Halaal and Kosher guests, which is spot on! • 40% didn’t think it was important for the host to let guests know who have all been invited, but Jan Braai’s advice is to do so ahead of time.
