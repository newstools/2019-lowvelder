The faces of the 93 grade four learners of Klipspringer Primary lit up when they were surprised by the McDonald’s and Lowvelder burger bust team. Each child received their own junior burger and juice and after saying grace together, they dug in.  This class was chosen because of how well behaved they are during the construction that is currently taking place at the school.  Lowvelder‘s marketing manager urged the class to continue with their exemplary behaviour.

Kabouterland Pre-Primary Créche and Nursery School in Steiltes received their #ImLovinIt #MacBust as a farewell gift from their teacher, Bianca Grundling who is serving her last month at the créche before embarking on a new venture.  When the team arrived at the nursery school, the tiny tots were out on a break and when they returned to class, their faces lit up at the sight of the treats on the desk.
