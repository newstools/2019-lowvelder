 According to official information received from two of the three recognized organised labour unions, the planned protest action is only scheduled for one day (Friday SeptemberÂ 20) with operations expected to be back to normal on Saturday. The protest action will be conducted specifically in the Kruger National Park, Paul Kruger Gate with staff from other parks encouraged to withdraw labour. To minimize any disruptions in the delivery of service to the guests due to the withdrawal of labour, SANParks would like to assure its guests that contingency plans are in place and will be activated with immediate effect in all parks.

All other entrance gates to the Kruger National Park and other parks will be operational as normal. It is for this reason that guests are advised not to cancel any bookings as a consequence of a one-day planned protest action announced by the two unions.  Should the CCMA grant organised labour permission to embark on a protracted strike action more information will be communicated.
