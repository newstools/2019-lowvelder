 This follows after wage negotiations between Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) and SANParks collapsed. Hospersa on Thursday threatened a shutdown at SANParks, including the Kruger National Park. Workers have previously downed tools but were persuaded to return to work while solutions were sought.

Negotiations collapsed at the Commission for Concilliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) after parties could not agree on a wage increase. It was recommended that parties settle for an eight per cent increase, but SANParks said it could only offer a 6,5 per cent increase. Roleplayers will now apparently meet on Wednesday to finalise plans for industrial action. Hospersa warned that industrial action by the three unions would affect day-to-day services that include household and tourist activities such as game drives and guided walks. Petrol filling stations will also be affected. Hospersa public relations officer, Kevin Halama, said their members initially demanded an 11 per cent increase, but were happy to settle for the eight per cent. The collapse of negotiations has now heightened tensions. ALSO READ: Mpumalanga Show shines with joy
