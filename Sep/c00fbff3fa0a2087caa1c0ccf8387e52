 MBOMBELA – The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) chief general, Solly Shoke, visited the city last Wednesday with a contingent of defence force personnel at the Army Support Base Combined Club. Central to the chief general’s address were plans to eliminate the military’s dependence on obtaining food and vegetables from other parties. He stressed the importance of the SANDF’s involvement in upskilling the reservists in the army by teaching them about farming, in order that they are able to sustain themselves during the times they are out of uniform.

Shoke said, “Globally, there is no country that is successful without a strong defence force. There is no economy that can grow if the defence force is weak.” In light of this, the SANDF has launched Operation “Koba Tlala”, which means “chasing away hunger”. The general touched on aspects in contemporary South African society which contribute to crime, adding that the migration of large portions of the population to urban areas creates a number of challenges, such as overcrowding and a scarcity of resources.

These resources have to be shared by a large number of people which leads to criminal activities being perpetrated, as they scramble for resources in order to live. The project is driven by the director of army reserves, Brig Gen Gerhard Kamffer, for the national defence force, and he aims to reskill reserves in the agricultural sector. This, Kamffer said, will create a vibrant, sustainable economy which supports food security. A number of stakeholders in the province attended the event and listened as Shoke outlined the benefits the initiative held for communities and the local economy.
