 MBOMBELA – After more than a year of complaining about sky-high water accounts residents received from the city’s bulk supplier, Silulumanzi, water users now have the opportunity to discuss these issues directly with the supplier. Increasing numbers of residents are complaining they are receiving ridiculously high bills, some as much as R40 000. Lowvelder has reported on the matter several times, and about how residents are concerned that their complaints about it to Silulumanzi are not taken seriously.

Their standard answer is that the residents must have water leaks in their properties. After the flood of complaints, most of them via the Facebook page, Mbombela Electricity & Water, which is driven by Thea Rix, Silulumanzi eventually agreed to a face-to-face meeting with their customers, to address all of their concerns. The public meeting is to be held on Wednesday September 11 at 17:00 in the council chambers of the City of Mbombela Local Municipality building in Nel Street.
