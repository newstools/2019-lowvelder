 “Every September we raise awareness of the importance of oral health in the local community. Most people are not aware that they might have a dental problem until it is giving them pain. By that stage the cavity is mostly close to the nerve and patients might need a root canal or extraction” Dr Liezl van der Walt explained. “We would love to bring the message across that prevention is better than cure. By visiting your dentist every 6 months small cavities can be identified and repaired easily most of the time even without the need for an injection. Gum infection and dental caries are by far the most common oral health problems we see on a daily basis and both can be prevented with optimum oral hygiene and reducing certain risk factors like high sugar intake and smoking” This year they teamed up with Colgate who donated toothbrushes and toothpastes for the first 100 people receiving screenings on the day. People attending will also receive free education on how to correctly take care of their teeth and advise on the factors negatively affecting their oral health. They are located in Jatra building, 71 van Wijk Street next to Laerskool Bergland.
