 MBOMBELA – During a press conference at the provincial IEC results operation centre at Mbombela Stadium, the acting PEO, Jabulisile Mthethwa, said the voting was running smoothly across the province. “It was so peaceful that I thought at one stage that I needed to phone the municipalities to see what is going on,” she joked.
