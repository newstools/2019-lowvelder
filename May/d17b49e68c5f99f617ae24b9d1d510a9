 MBOMBELA – Nothing could stop the 74-year-old Phumzile Mbhele from voting on Wednesday. She simply strapped her grandson to her back and made her way to KaNyamazane Community Hall where she cast her vote with glee. At the same venue a member of the community also brought his grandson with him “to teach him the principles of democracy from a young age”.  This perseverance was also evident when the 87-year-old Ameli Khoza walked to John Mduli Primary School in Mataffin to make her mark as well as 85-year-old MJ Mndawa who stood in line since 06:30 at Tekwane Primary School. “We have no water, no electricity and no jobs. If it will come right, I don’t know, but we are hoping for change,” Mndawa said.

They complained that the clinic was congested and that there was an overflow from other communities. “Following the election we are hoping for more jobs, easier access to clinics and a better life for everyone,” employee Leonard Zondi said. At John Mdluli Primary School, 22-year- old first-time voter, Prudance Mahabane was excited to make her mark. She was draped in an ANC flag and made no secret of who she was going to vote for.  “We are hoping for better and more direct communication from government following the election. We also have a problem with water supply in the area and I am hoping that this will also be resolved,” Mahabane said. ALSO READ: Thaba Chweu provisional 2019 provincial elections results
