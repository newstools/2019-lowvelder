The DBC choirmaster, Tobias Stuckelberger, or maestro as the boys refer to him, was delighted to be at the festival and said, “They have given us a great welcome. It is a chance for the boys to rest and enjoy what the Lowveld has to offer.”  The programme was filled with activities of all kinds and there was no shortage of entertainment for the whole family. Festival organiser, Tracey Russell, said, “We’re having a bumper year and are very excited about the Drakensberg Boys Choir and the Hocus Pocus theatre production. The support has been overwhelming this year and tickets were almost sold out by lunch time.” ALSO READ: Barberton no longer jewel of the Lowveld
