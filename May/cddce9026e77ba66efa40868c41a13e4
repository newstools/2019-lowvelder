The increase in the listed dams of the district is in line with the increase in the average water levels for the Mpumalanga Province which increased from last week’s 74,8 per cent to 74,9 per cent and the Inkomati-Usuthu catchment which recorded an increase from 77,5 per cent to 77,6 per cent whilst the Olifants catchment remained unchanged at 63.8 per cent. The consecutive increase in water levels in the Mpumalanga Province is a welcome situation as we head towards the dry winter season. Over 1000 COSATU members march for May Day in Mbombela “In as much as we appreciate and welcome the improvements in water levels, the Department of Water and Sanitation would like to re-emphasise the importance of water conservation and encourage the public to use the available water wisely as we head into the dry winter season. The Department would also like to encourage the public to protect groundwater resources as groundwater is a major alternative source of water in the midst of climate change. Water is life, so it is crucial that we all play a part in the conservation and protection of water resources for water security in our water scarce country.” Bass feeding frenzy expected to yield good results at LBT#4
