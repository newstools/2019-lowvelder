Milites Dei Academy is situated in the Sanderson House in Peebles Valley outside White River. The Bush Camp will host certain of the courses and is nestled in a Forest called Bush Camp Ego. One of the many statues found in South Africa was erected just outside the training venue. The statue of Jock of the Bushveld is nestled on a hill with a view of the Legogote Mountain ranges and offers breathe taking views of the surrounding flora and fauna.
