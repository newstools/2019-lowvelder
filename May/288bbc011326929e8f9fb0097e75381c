 Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison has been alerted that there are people spreading false rumours that traffic learnership posts can be secured by paying monies to the Mpumalanga Traffic Training College (MTTC) head, Busi Nkuna. Moeti Mmusi, spokesman for the department, said in a statement on Saturday that Nkuna has never received monies from any person for placement at the college. “We want to place it on record that Nkuna oversees operations at the college and matters relating to the college by relevant units in the department. Even with the officials responsible for selection processes, no monies are solicited from prospective learner cops,” Mmusi said.

We also call on any persons who have paid any money to come forward so that any claims are duly investigated,” Mmusi said in the statement. Job seekers should be aware that as long as they meet the requirements, they should freely apply. ALSO READ: Five tips to spot fake vacancies online
