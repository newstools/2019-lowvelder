He highlighted how remorse, if any, would not assist in bringing back the lives of the slain and the importance of sending a strong message to other would-be offenders on how seriously similar cases are viewed by the courts. The station commander of Elukwatini, Col Mfundisi Patrick Makamu, praised investigating officer, WO Makhosini Chadwick Nkosi, who took over the case after the former investigator passed away. I appreciate how the official dedicated himself to ensuring the results are eventually achieved. It is such commitment that eases the judicial officers’ work and restores the community’s trust in the dignified blue that we wish all officials could emulate,” he said.
