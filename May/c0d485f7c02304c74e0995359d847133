 MBOMBELA – The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, appeared in court on nine counts of rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming and two counts of sharing pornographic material with a minor, a schedule six offence. The man is accused of raping the girl between 2017 and 2019. Defence advocate Nico du Plessis said the man was the sole provider for his family and if he received bail, he would not go back to the home he shared with his wife and the victim. The company he works for would provide him alternative accommodation for the duration of the case. The accused was arrested after the mother noticed strange behaviour from the victim and self-inflicted cuts on her body. She made some enquiries and discovered that the child had been allegedly molested by the father since she was 12 years old. The accused stated in court that his company had offered him a place to stay if he was granted bail so he would not interfere with his wife and the victim. He also stated that he was the sole provider for the family. The matter was postponed until May 10 for the state to make its case in the bail application. The accused remains in custody.
