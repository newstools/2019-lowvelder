You must focus on your studies, so that you can be future leaders of the country. “I grew up in a disadvantaged background but I did not allow the situation to determine my future. I worked hard at school because I always aspired to be a better person. You also can make it, focus and make us proud. Please do not ruin your future when there are plenty of opportunities ahead of you,” he said.
