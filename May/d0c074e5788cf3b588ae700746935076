 WHITE RIVER – Thirteen-year-old Finlay Dalrymple has big dreams for his future. “I want to be an advocate or a civil engineer, but will always enjoy singing.” Finlay was excited to come home this weekend as the choir is performing at the Uplands Festival. He attended Uplands from 2010 to 2017 where he participated in choir, interhouse public speaking and was the goalkeeper for the A team hockey.

The festival is always lots of fun”. Finlay added that it would be a bit weird performing in front of his friends. He has always loved the Lowveld for its good weather and beautiful scenery. “If you live in a city, you won’t understand how beautiful the stars and trees can be, you can’t see anything but buildings and flashing lights.” • The choir will again perform this afternoon at 17:00. Tickets are available through quicket.co.za and at the door.
