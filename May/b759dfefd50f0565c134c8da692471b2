 It will all happen at the Mbombela Stadium from 11:00 to 12:00. Sixteen teams will battle for the winnerâ€™s honours in three classes and, considering those who entered, it may well prove to be an epic battle. The first schools to arrive for the pre-event scrutinisation on May 11 were Dasha and Flamboyant. In 2018 Dasha finished sixth overall and Flamboyant came in fifth. Other than the scrutinisation of the cars and a time trial to determine starting positions, teams must also present themselves to a panel of judges to tell and answer various questions about their preparation and building of their vehicle. Teams have to build their own car according to a preset list of specifications determined for the specific class in which they will compete.

Some of these cars can reach speeds of up to 45km/h. This dictates strict control during the race to ensure the safety of the drivers as well as spectators. Learners who have participated in this event in the past have always attributed much of their success in life and in personal growth to the many lessons they have learned through this participation. The organisers, all volunteers, do need support and financial assistance to enable more schools to participate, so you are encouraged to attend this event to see what it is all about and perhaps, it will also motivate your participation and or sponsorship support.
