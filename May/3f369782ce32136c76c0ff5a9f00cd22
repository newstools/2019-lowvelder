 From Australia to Peru, Mustang reigns as the best-selling sports coupé in the world for 2018, selling 113 066 cars, according to data from IHS Markit. 2018 not only marked the fourth straight year of Mustang’s global leadership as world’s best-selling sports coupé, but also as best-selling sports car in the United States, where Ford sold 75 842 Mustangs last year. Ford’s galloping pony remains one of the best-selling sports cars in South Africa, having sold 2 615 units since it went on sale locally in 2016. “We broke the mould when Ford launched the Mustang 55 years ago,” said Jim Farley, Ford president of global markets. “Nothing says freedom, the wind in your hair and the joy of driving like Mustang. It’s an icon. The roar of its V8 on a spring day, there’s nothing better.
