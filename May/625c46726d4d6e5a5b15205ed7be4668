 WHITE RIVER – Uplands captured the stars on the evening of its matric dance, held on Tuesday, April 30. The build-up to the celebration brought much excitement among the grade 12 pupils. Sarah Viljoen, an Uplands teacher, led the event and was ably supported by the school’s Matric Dance Committee.  The hall was beautifully transformed by a spectacular display of fairy lights and the accompaniment of gold and navy-blue finishes. The boys looked dashing in their tailored suits, and the natural sparkle of the girls was reflected in their elegant dresses.
