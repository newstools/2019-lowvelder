 Two nights of fantasy and wonder. That is how one can describe Penryn Preparatory’s pantomime that was held last Tuesday and Wednesday.    The script was adapted by Penryn teacher Jason Toy to include many of the town’s familiarities, including one of the characters having to place an advertisement in Lowvelder.

Definitely a recipe for success.    A cast of over 200 children had the opportunity to perform to a sold-out audience where both evenings were in a dinner-theatre style, a first for the school.

The result was nights of fun, laughter and many lasting memories.
It was wonderful to bear witness to many happy children who seemed to discover their love of the stage.
