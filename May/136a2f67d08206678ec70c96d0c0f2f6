 MBOMBELA – Aubrey Mnisi (22) was sentenced in the Nelspruit Regional Court after being convicted on three counts of rape, one of robbery with aggravating circumstances and two counts of housebreaking. Mnisi undertook his “reign of terror” from 2014 to 2015, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman, Monica Nyuswa. “Two of his victims are minors.” The court heard that Mnisi would break into a victims’ house at night, threaten them with a knife, rape them, and sometimes rob them.

He placed a net and linen on her face to conceal his face from her.” In another incident, Mnisi dragged a 13-year-old girl from her home, threatened her with a knife and raped her. When she screamed, he threw soil into her mouth. She ran to her neighbours for help and Mnisi was arrested. DNA samples linked him with other crimes. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor, Thulani Msibi led the testimony of 11 witnesses. Some of them told the court how the ordeal affected their lives. This was taken into consideration during sentencing. Mnisi was sentenced to life imprisonment on two count of rape and 10 years on another rape count, five years’ imprisonment on each count of housebreaking, and another 10 years for robbery. “Effectively, Mnisi will serve life imprisonment,” Nyuswa said.
