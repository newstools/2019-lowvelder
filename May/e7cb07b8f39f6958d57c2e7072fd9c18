 CANSA Lowveld has developed a brand new fun run, Tutus and Tekkies, to coincide with national Tekkie Tax Day on May 31. This fun run will not only be hosted once, but on two separate occasions. On May 31, locals can look forward to the run at White River Rugby Club, with children’s entertainment, a bar and fun for the whole family. Registration will start at 17:00 and the race at 19:00.
