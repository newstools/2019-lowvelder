 MBOMBELA – Enjoying meat over the coals has been a long-standing tradition among South Africans. Lowvelders, in particular, love nothing more than visiting with family and friends while the embers turn red and the meat is spiced. Sakkie van Rooyen, Joan Pretorius, Ockie Alberts, Chris Lombard and William Mbatha. The Jacaranda FM team, led by presenter Rian van Heerden, were in Michelle Street in West Acres this Friday to keep this proudly South African tradition alive. Lowvelder was greeted by the aromatic smells wafting from the braai stands lining the street. ALSO READ: Court in short: Farm manager found guilty and more Rian Van Heerden.
