 WHITE RIVER – More than 200 seniors of the White River community attended the tea and fashion gala with a twist. Local seniors played the part of models and dressed to the nines with the best outfits they had in their closets.  “You can be gorgeous at 30, charming at 40, and irresistible for the rest of your life.”- Coco Chanel These were the words that Care Buddies founder Yvonne McHeath used to open the mornings festivities at the Dutch Reformed Church in White River. Then it was time for the fashion show to commence with several seniors from old age homes in White River strutting the catwalk in their loveliest couture. Take a look at the Fashion Gala that was lived streamed here. Uplands College students accompanied the models from their chairs and down the catwalk and impressed the enthusiastic crowd with their choreographed moves. Matching canes and walkers were carefully selected to compliment the seniors outfits.   Yvonne Constant (80) participated in her first fashion show and she  mastered the art of seamlessly strutting down the stage with her walker.
