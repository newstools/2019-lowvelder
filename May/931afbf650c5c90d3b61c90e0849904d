SuperSport have secured the rights for the region and the cash-strapped SABC has battled to negotiate deals with SuperSport over the last few years to broadcast matches. This raised questions about whether national teams’ matches should be available to the public on the public broadcaster’s channels. Lowvelder asked residents how they watch television, and what they watch. This is what the residents had to say:   Cynthia KhozaI have a satellite dish at home. I only watch gospel and house music. I wish to have a DSTV Explora to be able to watch my favourites music shows at my own time but unfortunately it is expensive and I can’t afford it. Nomthandazo MlotshwaFor me TV is to watch music. I enjoy watching channels like the Soweto. They play the type of music that I enjoy. Phumlani ShabanguI have a satellite dish at home and I’m a regular TV watcher. I enjoy watching news, sports and soapies. Musa MoyaneI’m watching TV from a satellite. I enjoy talk shows like the Steve Harvey Show. It offer advice with jokes that makes you relax while watching it. Xolani SibiyaI don’t have that much time for TV as I’m a student and I’m always on the move. When I do have time and data’s on my mobile phone, I watch you tubes to follow soccer highlights, cartoons and news happening around. Qondile MambaneI does not usually sit down and watch TV. Fortunately, I pay DStv and in most cases I rely on DStv Explora to catch up on shows that I missed. Most often I enjoy talk shows because they are motivating.
