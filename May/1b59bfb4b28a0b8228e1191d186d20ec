 WATERVAL BOVEN – The residents of SAVF Silverdays celebrated Easter weekend by showing that they are still valuable members of the community. They spent Saturday cleaning up the streets of the town as a part of the Boven Reboot initiative started last year. “It was great fun and a bit of gymnastics. I could see how fit my residents are that they could bend down and pick up rubbish with such great enthusiasm to help make a difference in Boven,” Silverdays manager, Gail Fish said.  The initiative’s goal is to restore the town to its former glory, with all the locals joining hands. According to Rudolph Pretorius, who is part of Boven Reboot, Ishmael Abdullah, Emakhazeni Local Municipality unit manager and his team, also lent a hand during the weekend by cleaning up the main street in town on the Friday.
