 MBOMBELA – If you are creative and have a big heart for charity, then Nelspruit Hospice’s brand-new Chair-A-Tee charity initiative is definitely for you.
As a part of National Hospice Week, which they celebrated this week, the initiative was launched at i’langa Mall on Tuesday.

You then decorate it in any way you like – permitted that someone can still sit on it.  Your chair (or chairs) are then given back to Nelspruit Hospice, and they will be exhibited in i’langa Mall throughout the month of August.  In September, the chairs will be auctioned to raise funds for the organisation. “Every cent that is made here, is spent here,” Nelspruit Hospice’s outgoing CEO, Mary Lebotschy, said at the launch. “We are the only home-based organisation in the city. We have helped more than 700 families since we started in 2006 and we want to keep on going, but in order to do that we need funds.”  Mica’s Sarah Koster had her teams decorate some chairs ahead of the function to illustrate all the possibilities for decorating. She urged individuals and businesses to challenge one another to raise as much as possible funds for this formidable charity.
