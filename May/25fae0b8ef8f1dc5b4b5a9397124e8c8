A woman, disguised as a man and armed with a firearm, stormed into the bank holding a teller and a security guard hostage. She ordered them to fill a big bag full of cash before fleeing from the scene.” A few days after the incident, an intense investigation revealed that the robbery may have been a collaboration between the bank teller, security guard and two women. “The teller and security guard were traced and arrested.” ALSO READ: Two accidents at one of Kruger National Park’s gates “After questioning the others, police discovered that the loot had been smuggled into South Africa where it was to be kept safe at Nhlazatshe, Elukwatini near Badplaas, until it was safe to share it among the four.” The local police traced the location and apprehended the two women at their hiding place in Tjakastad.
