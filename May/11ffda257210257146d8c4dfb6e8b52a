 BARBERTON – This year the theme was Mary Poppins and the guests were treated to a high tea. As in the past, hostesses were responsible for decorating their tables and seeing to the well-being of their special guests. Some even dressed accordingly, and prizes were handed out during the course of the morning.

The younger ladies also had a turn to strut their stuff during their own fashion show. There was no lack of confidence as the young ladies entertained the guests. A special turn of events was the celebration of Margaret Sebastian’s 99th birthday. She was an inspiration to all.
