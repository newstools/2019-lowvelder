 I was attending the show for the third time and continue to be amazed at the level of excellence achieved in terms of exhibits, layout, ambience, and activation opportunities. Members of our group of 10, under the banner of the Pretoria Old Motor Club, enjoyed a variety of memorable experiences, such as riding in a pukka ox-wagon drawn by huge Afrikaner oxen to travelling in military convoys and riding in trains pulled by beautifully restored locomotives.  There were several classic cars and motorcycles on display in one of the halls, while the visiting Triumph and Lotus car clubs, among others, added further variety.

However, for the photographers, nothing beats the Mountain Wanderer Trip, which is the sunset train ride around the full circuit of the narrow-gauge rail network, totalling 26 kilometres. Not only does the train pass vast fields of blooming Cosmos flowers (the sunflowers were not yet in bloom), but driving alongside the train for photo opportunities were a variety of vehicles from a 1939 BSA, Ford Model A with “dickie seat” and Ford Model T bakkie to a coal-burning, steam-powered 1939 Sentinel truck.  Meanwhile, flying overhead in formation were a Harvard, Tiger Moth and two Chipmunks. At this stage there is no decision as to whether the Stars of Sandstone will shine again next year, but visiting this beautiful working farm is to come to a place of reminiscing and memories.
