 BARBERTON – “I cannot and should not be afraid when I believe with all my heart in righteousness and my Heavenly Father’s will.” This was local journalist Etienne Mare view on the controversy surrounding a video he released on May 8. In the video, that showed him voting twice, he alleged that the voting system is flawed. In the video he also interviewed a woman who claimed that she had voted three times. Both Mare and the woman, Malinda Halloway, were subsequently arrested for contravening the Electoral Act and were released on bail of R1 000 each.

According to him, his goal with the video was to point out to the IEC as well as the public that there were gaps in polling stations that could harm the democracy of the election and therefore needed to be addressed as soon as possible. The IEC’s national spokesman, Kate Bapela, has not yet responded as to what the IEC’s comment is on the public’s outcry, what is the IEC going to change to ensure that a situation like this does not happen again, how many people in the country were arrested for similar cases, and how the outcome of the election can then be valid if there is a possibility that more people could have voted more than once.
