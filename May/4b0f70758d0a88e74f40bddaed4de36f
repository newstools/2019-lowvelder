 MBOMBELA –  In a final electioneering effort, and after many postponements, President Cyril Ramaphosa finally paid a speedy visit to Bushbuckridge on Monday. Pundits are predicting that it is a make-or-break election, and the most important to determine the country’s future since the first democratic election
25 years ago. The new generation of voters showed their grasp of the grave issues facing the country during a heated debate held at Penryn College on Friday.  The six parties presented came under fire from the pupils, who bombarded them with questions on pressing issues such as climate change, land expropriation without compensation, service delivery and corruption.

One question that caused an uproar in the audience was whether the ANC’s alleged victim mentality would be a hindrance in its efforts to lead the nation. All six parties responded to the question. The ANC’s Pholoso Mbatsane responded to the question by saying the country still has a predominantly white economy. “We cannot shy away that blacks were disadvantaged,” the party said.  The VF+ Colleen Farrel in turn remarked that “when the ANC bring up an argument about race, we have to remember that we are mothers and sisters and fathers and brothers. If we work together, this country can be magnificent”.  The EFF’s Zweli Malope agreed with the VF+, saying no man is born a racist. “But why are the ownership patterns still divided along racial lines? We will have a victim mentality until we can all contribute to the economy equally.”  “In South Africa we need to do away with black and white,” the ACDP’s Bennet Thobela said, and added that part of the problem in South Africa was the implementation of BEE that led to many unskilled workers.  According to the DA’s Dumisile Masuku, they are a non-racial, non-sexist party. On the issue of ownership of land they said, “We first need to look at the land in the hands of the government. The land is available. We just need to give it to the people.”  COPE’s Rob Hutchinson said they agreed that there was injustice in the past. “The problem is victims cannot solve problems in the future, as they keep on looking to the past. Why would we just transfer the land? We want to reform the land that is already available, create new farms with double the growth, double the produce as well as double the jobs.”  ALSO READ: Trek jou kruisie voor jy kla The IEC opened its provincial results centre at Mbombela Stadium on Friday.
