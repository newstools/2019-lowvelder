SPAR McCoy Pies are the real thing – a gourmet filling bursting with flavour wrapped in light, crispy pastry. They’re the new go-to on-the-go meal. McCoy Pies have a raw weight of 250 g – some 55 g more than the average available single-serving pie currently on the market. They are therefore perfect for a lunch or quick dinner. McCoy pies aren’t only bigger than others, they also contain more meat in the delicious slow-cooked fillings, making them wonderful and filling. With McCoy pies, you know you’re getting premium cuts of meat that have been cooked to perfection. The veggies that have been added to the McCoy pies enrich the flavour of the meat and gravy. If only all pies tasted like this! SPAR McCoy gourmet pies are available in eight flavours. A sausage roll is also available. McCoy pies are exclusive to SPAR.
