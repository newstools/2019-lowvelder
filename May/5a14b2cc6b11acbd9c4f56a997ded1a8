 UPDATE “Away with slave wages” and “to hell with zero per cent.” Those were among the slogans of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) members at their strike today.  The union members are all allegedly employees at the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). They closed the entrance to the ARC yesterday and also barred the road with burning tyres, rocks and tree branches. Other employees were blocked from entering. When the police arrived at the scene around 09:00 to ask the strikers to let workers in, they responded with “injury to one is an injury to all” and that this is a nationwide strike.  The members told the newspaper that their list of demands included a 12,5 per cent increase and demanded that both the CEO and the board chairman of the ARC must vacate their positions. One of the Nehawu members told the newspaper that they would halt their protest for the election tomorrow, but that they would continue on Thursday should their demands not be met.  According to provincial police spokesman, Col Mthsoli Bhembe, their members are there and they are monitoring the situation and are trying to diffuse it. “Barricaded the entrance to the centre, but the main road has not been affected,” Bhembe said.
