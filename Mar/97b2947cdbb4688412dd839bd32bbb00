 MBOMBELA – According to White River Flying Squad leader Capt Pieter Smit, he was doing shopping while off duty when he passed Dion Wired and noticed that the shop looked empty. “I walked past and went into another shop as I was trying to upgrade my phone. Then I saw security guards rushing past me chasing after some men.” Smit , called in and found out that there had been six armed men who had held up the staff of Dion Wired. “They fled the scene in a white Toyota Single Cab bakkie. The registration number plates were false as they belonged to a Golf.” An ER24 paramedic at the scene told Lowvelder that none of the staff had been injured. “We are transporting one patient and Hi-Tech Medical Services will be transporting another patient to hospital for shock.” Dion Wired remained closed as police were still busy investigating the crime scene. Police and security companies are still searching for the suspects.
