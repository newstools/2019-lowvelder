 One person died and seven people sustained minor injuries in a head on collision between a bus and light delivery vehicle on the R40 between White River and Casterbridge earlier this evening. Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison spokesman, Moeti Mmusi, confirmed that the deceased was the driver of the bakkie. The bus was travelling from White River to Masoyi. The injured were all travelling in the bus, and were taken to Kiaat Hospital and the Nelspruit MediClinic for medical treatment. The bus driver was amongst the injured. According to Martin Jeffrey of Emer-G-Med the collision apparently happened when the Toyota Hilux overtook the Buscor bus, lost control and hit bus head on.  SAPS forensics was on scene soon and traffic relayed through a detour including the old runway next to the Bagdad Centre. According to Jeffry the road would stay closed for at least two to three hours while the deceased would be extricated from the vehicle and clean-up of the scene could be done.
