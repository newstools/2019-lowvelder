 MBOMBELA – Hundreds of participants showed up for the very popular Color Run at Laerskool Laeveld last Thursday. They had the choice of either running or walking and powder paint was available for purchase beforehand. The run was a feel-good, happy, and of course colourful event. Runners of all shapes and sizes merrily went from wearing pristine white clothing to being covered in bright neon paint. At each kilometre and water mark, a different colour of powder filled the air and covered the participants, creating a rainbow coloured mass of people. Food and drink stalls also provided some sustenance afterwards. Sandra Esmeraldo, principal of the main sponsor Huizemark, said they believe in giving back to the community in which they operate. “We are a fun team and that is why we support a fun event,” she said.
