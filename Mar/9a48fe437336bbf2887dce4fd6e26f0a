 MBOMBELA – A 62-year-old alleged paedophile needs to move out of the security complex he currently resides in before his next court appearance on April 12. This decision was made at the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court, where the man appeared on Friday. He was first arrested at the same complex in September last year and faces a charge on two counts of sexual assault of minors as well as a charge of illegal possession of a firearm. During his appearance on Friday the state argued that the accused must move out of the complex that he is currently in, as the alleged victims still live in the same complex. They added that this was one of the state’s conditions when bail was granted.

The magistrate replied that they have had enough time and if the suspect does not move out by the time of his next court appearance, bail will be revoked. “The victims are not the ones who have to move out. Under no circumstances can the court say this must happened. Keeping this is mind we still have to invoke the rights of the suspect,” the magistrate said.
