The ANC’s chairman, Gwede Mantashe, also spoke at the service. “When you sacrifice yourself, you invite the ANC to be a part of your family. We are part of the Mthembu family and we will mourn with them.” He urged the family to not blame each other for Mthembu’s death or to search for “signs that you could have missed” that could have lead to her suicide. He said that they should rather turn to God as “God is my rock, my fortress and my saviour.” ALSO READ: Lily and Barbrook sale is cancelled
