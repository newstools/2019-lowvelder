 This five-year-old had cochlear implant done a few years ago, however, nothing changed. He was only two years old at the time. He was born on October 21 2013, with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, causing him to turn blue due to a lack of oxygen. The family still believe in him, but they need all the support they can get from the public. They need about R274 000 so that the implant can be done, hopefully allowing Logan to hear.

Logan also has other siblings who require support. She said they are planning to host a fund-raising event on April 27. “His medical aid cannot cover this, since they categorise this as cosmetic. There are a lot of things that the family still pays for. We also have a trust, though it does not cover petrol and some other things,” she said.
