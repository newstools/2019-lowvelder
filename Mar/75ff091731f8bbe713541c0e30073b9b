 MBOMBELA – The storm has been described by the United Nations as the worst disaster to strike the southern hemisphere. Nicky Alexander who lives in Jeffrey’s Bay said her daughter Tamara Hurling and her grandson were stranded. “ The signal is bad. I get a few messages and then the line goes dead. I know their location, they are in Mascarengha, opposite the Sagrada Familia Church. It is the house right next to school after the bridge that leads to airport in Manga.” “If anyone can go and rescue them and she has her three dogs with her. They are her family too. I know my daughter, she will not want to leave her pets behind.” ALSO READ: Pilot recounts devastation seen during survey of destruction left by Cyclone Idai Alexander added that she knew the dire situation rescue workers had in the area. “I just want someone to help my daughter. I know there are many there that need help. They just do not have food or water and I don’t know how much longer they can hold on.” Photo by Fanie Jordaan. She said her daughters house had been flooded. “It is three storey house so they have moved to the top part.” Alexander fears the worst as news that Zimbabwe’s dams had opened their sluice gates and tons of water was heading towards the area. More than 300 people are now known to have died when the storm hit, but there are fears the final toll will be much higher. Cyclone Idai lashed Beira with winds of up to 170 kilometres per hour last Thursday, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions at risk.
