 GRASKOP – With its amazing natural beauty, the province has always been a popular destination for both domestic and international tourists but it was desperate for something new to reignite interest in its many established offerings. Enter Graskop Gorge Lift Co, which opened in December 2017. It was the biggest investment in tourism infrastructure in Mpumalanga in recent years and has in no small way played its parts in making the province a preferred adventure destination. The figures speak for themselves. From January to December 2018, 128 000 people visited the site and 63 411 paid to go down the lift and into the forest below.  “We are committed to making the beauty of our province accessible to more people in a sustainable and responsible manner,” said Oupa Pilane, one of the directors. Graskop Gorge Lift is situated on the Panorama Route and in close proximity to God’s Window, the Lisbon, Berlin and Mac Mac Falls, the Blyde River Canyon, Bourke’s Luck Potholes and the Three Rondawels – and is en route to the Kruger.
