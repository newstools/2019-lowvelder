 MBOMBELA –  The report states that  Invest 98S, a tropical depression in the Mozambican channel intensified to a moderate tropical storm overnight. This tropical storm is now called #Idai and has been named by Meteo France, and is intensifying off the western coast of Madagascar this morning. The storm could rapidly intensify as it turns south and then westwards over the Mozambique Channel, with a landfall likely in central Mozambique on Thursday or Friday as an intense cyclone.

The precursor to Idai has already killed 23 in Malawi, with 12 still missing and 29 injured. Green alert for Mozambique has been issued and direct impact remains high. Idai has maximum winds of 75 kilometers per hour and maximum gusts of 110 kilometers per hour. At this stage it poses a minimal threat to South Africa but they are monitoring the situation and by Tuesday night they will be able to forecast possible impacts should there be anything.
