 MBOMBELA – According to Nelspruit SAPS spokesman, Capt Zandile Gqawa, the case was postponed to March 3.
“Thulani Dlamini (35) and Mthokozisi Gumede (28) were charged with armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm. They are remanded in custody,” she said. This follows after the victim with his friends withdrew cash from a bank at Crossing Shopping Centre. The four suspects followed him home driving a black Audi, and proceeded to threaten the victim with a firearm and rob him of an undisclosed amount of money. After he was robbed the victim immediately called the police and followed the Audi in another one of his cars. The suspects headed back to Crossing. The courtesy attendants from Crossing assisted the police during their chase of the suspects. The first suspect was arrested at Crossing and the second suspect was caught at The Square, a centre opposite. The police recovered some cash, a nine-millimetre pistol with live ammunition and a toy gun. The black Audi was also impounded. SAPS are investigating the possibility that these suspects might be linked to other armed robbery cases with the same modus operandi.
