 MBOMBELA – “The road is long with many a winding turn that leads us to who knows where, but I’m strong enough to carry him, he ain’t heavy, he’s my brother.” This Hollies song was played to Penryn’s grade eights by their headmaster, Albert Pienaar, at their recent tie ceremony.  “The tie is symbolic of this moment. Until now you have not been allowed to wear the Penryn tie. From today for the rest of your time at the college, you will represent this school whenever and wherever you wear your tie.

The grade 12 learners were called upon to hand a Penryn tie to the grade eight buddy who they were assigned at the beginning of the year.  “I have the utmost trust that you will teach these youngsters the Penryn way of life,” Pienaar said to the grade 12s.  Penryn head boy, Heath Anderson and head girl, Tebogo Mokoena lit the candles that the grade eights were holding. The morning also included praise and worship.
