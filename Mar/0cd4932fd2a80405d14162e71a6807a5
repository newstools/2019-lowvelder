 The provincial Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC, Pat Ngomane, has warned fraudsters to stop preying on vulnerable job seekers by making them pay for jobs that do not exist or were not advertised. Ngomane was responding to wrong information spread by unscrupulous individuals that the department as well as Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) have advertised traffic learnership posts. The MEC has reiterated his call to members of the public to disregard such people and not give them any money.

He has further appealed to job seekers to always verify the authenticity of job advertisements that are sometimes placed on social media with the relevant departments and entities. He further explained the traffic learners that the department is aware of were sent by  North West, various municipalities across Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces. These learners started with 12 months of basic traffic officers’ training at Mpumalanga Traffic Training College this week. ALSO READ: WATCH: Pumas rugby team showcase their other talents on stage
