The off campus residences are not getting meal allowances due to the new circular six released by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET).

EMC and DHET are still playing hide and seek on the issue of meal allowance,” he explained. According to the students, the issue of meal allowance is very close to their hearts. “The students are starving yet we are told about NSFAS and DHET. We are rejecting circular six of NSFAS. NSFAS and DHET must cancel circular because they never consulted any university regarding it and this circular is a disgrace to our students. All students must get meal allowances whether staying or not staying in the campus,” said the student. ALSO READ:VIDEO: Buscor bus burns on TUT campus
