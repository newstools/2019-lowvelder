 KANYAMAZANE – The first batch of 1 050 badly damaged houses has been fixed.mThis was the message conveyed by the spokesman for human settlements, Freddy Ngobe, regarding the repairs of houses following a severe hailstorm last May. The department previously defined these 1 050 houses as those worst affected by the storm, including all the houses that were left roofless. A total of 2 130 residences were damaged. The department, however, could not explain why there are still houses without roofs, which was also pointed out when president Cyril Ramaphosa visited the area on Sunday. The residents of KaNyamazane covered their roofless houses with blue tarpaulin.

The residents of KaNyamazane covered their roofless houses with blue tarpaulin. According to him, the delivery of the 1 050 badly damaged houses was realised through reprioritising the department’s internal resources, while the national department has since granted the R120 million that is required to complete the project. Lowvelder also previously wrote about Dinah Lekhuleni, who passed away in her house that still had not been completely repaired since the storm hit.

It can be confirmed though that her house is part of the remaining ones which fall under the second phase of the project,” Ngobe said. The minister for human settlements, Nomaindia Mfeketo, visited the area on Saturday and commended the department on the strides made thus far in repairing storm-damaged houses.
