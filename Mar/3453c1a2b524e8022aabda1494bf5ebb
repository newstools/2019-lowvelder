 WHITE RIVER –  The Circle of Light Festival was held at Da Loose Mongoose and hosted a variety of stalls that showcased a holistic and spiritual approach to personal well-being. The festival was originally started by Di Atherton and is now the responsibility of Wendy Du Plessis.  “This is about treatment for the mind, body and spirit and we are really amazed at the tremendous outcome that we have here today,” Du Plessis said.  According to both her and Atherton, they plan to hold no more than two of these festivals per year. Interested parties can look forward to perhaps having another festival in spring.

Festivalgoers also participated in a meditation circle and a panel discussion that focused on the holistic approach. There was also a meditation circle for children as well as a releasing ritual that aimed to help festivalgoers release all the negative energy from their lives.  Truly one of its kind, the festival was well supported and attendees were smiling from ear to ear. ALSO READ: 90th Birthday Celebrations at Uplands Festival 2018
