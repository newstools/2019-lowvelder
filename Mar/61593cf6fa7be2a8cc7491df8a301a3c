 MBOMBELA – Sesamotho Funeral Services owner Robert Marks said his funeral parlour had handed the coffins with the bodies inside over to the family for transportation as they had not had the funds to pay them for the transportation. According to a Mozambican consulate official, the bodies of two men and one woman were been transported by a private funeral service from Johannesburg and were on their way to Maputo province and Gaza. When it was found that the paperwork was not in order for the bodies to cross the border, the coffins were dumped on the side of the road.

Our offices in Pretoria together with the department of health arranged the paperwork, “said a consulate official. The paperwork was completed on Tuesday and all the bodies had been repatriated to Mozambique.
