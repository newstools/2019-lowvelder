 It is about 50km from Mbombela on the Schoemanskloof Road. The farm is high up in the mountains, with plenty of tracks and obstacles to explore. They will do that trip again.They had a total of 14 vehicles on the run. For two of the drivers, it was the first outing. Vehicles consisted of short-wheel-base Pajeros, Land Cruisers, a Jeep Cherokee, and the rest of the group was a mixed brand of your standard long-wheelbase 4×4 bakkies.  Driver of the day was awarded to Renier Janse van Rensburg, who displayed good driving skills and did not get stuck once on any of the obstacles.
