 MBOMBELA – The organisation says that its supplies are so low due to the fact that they are running a shelter packed to more than capacity the whole time. “The number of animals we need to take in or that people surrender has increased, while our adoptions have gone down drastically,” vice-chairman of the shelter, Ludi Botha said. According to him, the adoption rate is only 50 per cent of what it should be in order for them to operate effectively. Botha pleaded with the community to stay clear of breeders and to rather call on the shelter to adopt pets. He also encouraged people to donate money or food to the shelter if it is within their means. ALSO READ: Animal cruelty emergency?
