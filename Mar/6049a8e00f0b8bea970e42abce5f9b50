 “An artist is only as good as his last performance” – Jonathan Peyper. Jonathan’s answer to the daily routine of a local rock star surprised us. Instead of the hill-top houses, and fifteen cars Nickelback sings about, his day consists of admin tasks, responding to emails, making banners for marketing and lots of practice every day. His first guitar was relatively economically priced but not any less special than a brand new expensive one and even more adored. Peyper has now upgraded to a 1988 Japanese fender Stratocaster and would love to have every sort of guitar in the world.  He would like to play more instruments; violin, saxophone, piano and, something that he has already begun but would like to further his ability in, drums.
