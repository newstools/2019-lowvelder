The storm knocked out communications in Beira as well as damaging roadways and access points hindering response efforts. Photos supplied by MAF. MAF pilot Rick Emenaker said on March 18 they conducted an aerial survey flight along the road from Beira towards Chimoioand then south to the Buzi River. The survey revealed significant damage to the EN6 roadway, with entire sections washed out by flood water, other areas still under water and bridges damaged or gone. Photo supplied by MAF “It was a heartbreaking flight today as we flew over many miles of flooded land in the Buzi River basin. We saw many people stranded on roof tops surrounded by kilometres of water. It was difficult to comprehend and think about that probably many have perished.” The flight continued south into the Buzi river basin, an area where no information was yet known. This area has deep and widespread flooding – entire buildings under water. “A number of villages were completely buried in the flood waters. The magnitude of this disaster is hard to comprehend and we are glad we are able to be here to help. Please keep the people of Mozambique in your  prayers as they struggle with this difficult situation that has no short term end in sight.”
