 MBOMBELA – The MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) in Mpumalanga recently called on communities not to risk their lives by swimming in rivers and dams. UPDATE: Cyclone Idai intensified to a category 4 Cyclone As a way to help curb the drownings, the department launched a Water Safety Awareness Campaign, visiting three schools at Elukwatini in collaboration with Mpumalanga Diving Unit, Mpumalanga Parks Board, Elukwatini Fire and Rescue Services, Carolina Disaster Management and Elukwatini Vispol.
The schools visited were Mkolishe High School, Maqhawuzela Secodary School and Imbondvu Primary School. This campaign was initiated after 37 people drowned from December to mid-February, just in the Ehlanzeni district.
The MEC, Speed Mashilo, attributed this to extremely warm temperatures that results in people swimming in local rivers and dams. Mashilo added that these drowning cases are a serious cause for concern.

“Our province is experiencing soaring, hot temperatures and as such, our communities are enticed to swim in the local rivers and dams to cool themselves off. Unfortunately, some do not find their way back. We call on all communities not put themselves into this kind of danger,” he said.
Cogta is responsible for disaster management and has established a disaster toll-free number as one of the life-saving measures. Mashilo appealed to the communities to use the number to report drownings. “These drowning cases can be prevented through cooperation between our communities and our government. We call on our communities to call the
0800-202-507 toll-free number to save lives. We also call on parents not to allow their children to swim without supervision,” Mashilo said. Sugar tax increase and weak protection
