 WHITE RIVER –  According to Estelle de Villiers, it is low on food supplies but is receiving a lot of support from the community and hopes to have even more support with the various fundraisers planned. De Villiers is the shelter’s treasurer, but from April 1 she will be chairman, a position she has held before and is ready to take on again with full force. “It costs R60 000 per month just to keep our doors open and we have to raise all of those funds ourselves,” she said. Estelle de Villiers. One of their biggest fundraisers is the car boot sale, which takes place on the first Saturday of every month in the Casterbridge Centre parking lot. Here sellers have the opportunity to book their spot at R100 per car, which goes to the SPCA. All proceeds made on the day are for your own pocket. De Villiers said, apart from smaller fundraisers, she is very excited about the two major events that they will host this year. The first is a second-hand clothing sale called Nearly New that will be happening at Zannas on May 30 from 16:00 to 21:00. “It is like a pop-up shop with previously loved clothes.” For this event you can also donate your second-hand items at the shelter.

Those who are interested in the day-to-day operations of the shelter, can attend the annual general meeting on July 10.
“We are looking for committee members and volunteers who want to make a difference and be a voice for the voiceless.”
