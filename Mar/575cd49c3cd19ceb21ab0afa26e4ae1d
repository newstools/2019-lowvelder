 The sport of archery is taking flight in a big way in Barberton, according to Gateway Christian School principal, Lindie Ehlers. The school recently hosted the Southern African Christian School’s Sports Association (SACSSA) Inter-school Archery Championships at Barberton High School. SEE ALSO: The Annual Barberton Rugby Tournament in pictures Schools from Ermelo, Komatipoort and White River filled their quivers and let loose their arrows to compete. The ancient sport has seen a decline over the years, but is seeing a revival across the globe and enthusiasts, or bowmen, are pitting their skills against each other over a number of distances to see who is able to hit the target. It was certainly no different for the youngsters who competed for first place and bragging rights at the SACSSA tournament. Front: Kago Markalla, Monde Majola, Ruan Fourie, Diehahn Strauss, (back) Daniella Strauss, Shanre Ehlers and Juan Fourie.
