The Barnyard is a superb venue in the Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre which is ideal for hosting a range of events including live shows with musicians, individual performers, comedians or theatre. The Barnyard also hosts corporate events, private parties and other social functions. The setting is informal, but can easily be laid out for that special occasion. The friendly bar often flows outdoors to a peaceful area under mango trees where outdoor catering can be facilitated for potjies, curries, roasts, breakfasts and braais (standard, spit or rotisserie, burgers, prego’s or prawns), . Weekend sport is often shown on the big screen. The Barnyard is a fully operational community event venue with a seating capacity of between 50 – 300 people sitting at benches and tables (Barnyard style) depending on the table layout.
