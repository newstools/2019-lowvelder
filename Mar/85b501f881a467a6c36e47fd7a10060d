This political party wants to create a safe and prosperous country for all its citizens, a country of which we can all be justifiably proud. The leader of the ACDP, Rev Kenneth Meshoe, has appealed to the party supporters to use their right to vote to bring about change. He has been in parliament since 1994 and comes with a wealth of experience. He also stands tall, with an unblemished reputation of integrity. Meshoe says the country is statistically 79% Christian. It is time for the people to put their mark where their faith is.  Rev Meshoe recently launched the party’s election manifesto in Kuils River, Cape Town. The theme for the party’s election manifesto is Unite, Build, Grow. The manifesto focuses on seven giants that are facing our nation at present. The ACDP aims to address each of these giants: 1. High unemployment
2. Poor economic growth
3. Substandard education and skills development
4. Inadequate health services
5. Escalating crime
6. Corruption in public and private sectors
7. The threat to property rights and rural development The ACDP is experiencing rapid growth across Mpumalanga, with multiple branches being launched weekly.
