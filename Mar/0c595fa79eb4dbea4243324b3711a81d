 MBOMBELA – On Thursday night Sappi launched its annual Mother’s Day concert with an affair fit for bushveld royalty. The event was held on the lawn of the Lowveld National Botanical Garden, which was decorated with candles, fairy lights and a marquee with no sail to showcase the natural beauty of the trees.  This year’s concert will be held on May 12 at the garden. Sappi regional communications manager, Elsabé Coetzee, announced that from this year going forward they will honour a bird and tree indigenous to the garden. This year they have decided to pay homage to the Lowveld chestnut as well as the majestic African paradise flycatcher.

He gave a cheque of more than R120 000 to SANBI representatives – the proceeds from last year’s concert. However, they made sure not to only focus on the past, but to shine the spotlight on what will be happening this year.  Attendees can look forward to three stages, including the main stage where Stella, Just 6 and international sensation Matthew Mole will perform. This year’s concert will be hosted by Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp and promises great food stalls, drinks as well as entertainment for children.  Tickets cost R85 for adults, R45 for pensioners and primary school children and preschool children enter for free. ALSO READ: VIEW: Sappi Mother’s Day 2018
