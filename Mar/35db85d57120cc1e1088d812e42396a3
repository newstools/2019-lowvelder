 MBOMBELA – The locally born blues guitarist Jonathan Peyper returned to the city with a bang last Friday night, performing with his band at The Pub.  Jonathan first picked up a guitar at the age of 12 and on that day a guitar virtuoso was born. In 2007 (at the age of 17), he was invited to perform with Dan Patlansky where his love of blues rock music started.

He is known for his energetic and flawless performances and the show lived up to expectations, with an electrifying blues fuelled by a rock persona of note.
