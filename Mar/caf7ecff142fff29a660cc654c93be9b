 It is unpleasant, and beauty workers are losing clientelle. Diana Roux, from Face to the Wind, said they have to schedule their clients appointments around the hours which they will have power.    “We recently had to let our client go home without completing his chest wax. The wax got cold and we had to stop. We only managed to do half the work and he had to come back later when we had power. It also affects us when it comes to getting our clients’ nails done, since we need the gel lamp UV to get the gel dry and we also cannot use a steamer,” she said.

Some appointments are not met because of traffic influence and clients arrive late. The card machine and landline system are slow due to us using a generator. “We have Internet and WiFi connectivity problems and this influences our bookings,” she said.

It really affects us when we have to do a blow wave. We also design flower arrangements for events but that has to stop too when we do not have power and we have orders to complete,” he said. Carol Jacobs, from CJ’s Hair, said even with a generator it is not easy to get the usual work done. “We can use a hair dryer but the heat is not as high as we normally have it,” she said. Leticia Janse van Vuuren from Beauty Inn, said when the power keeps going on and off it damages their equipment.
