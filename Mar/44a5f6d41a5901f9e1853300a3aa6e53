 The pupils of Penryn Preparatory celebrated World Book Day last Thursday by dressing up as their favourite literary characters. Every pupil also donated books to the school’s non-profit organisation, Penreach. This event paved the way for Penryn Prep’s preschool annual Teddy Bears’ Picnic.

The evening was full of fun as children, parents and teachers went off on a treasure hunt as the sun was setting, collecting goodies along the way”.    Eva said that a highlight for the little ones was to sip their hot chocolate and have stories read to them by the head and deputy head of the Preparatory School, as well as Eva herself.

As this year’s picnic fell on the same day as World Book Day, the children also donated books to support the Penreach initiative,” Eva said.
