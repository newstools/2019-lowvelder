Rescue teams on Tuesday had to make a hard choice and assessed that there were others in more dire situations that needed help first. Karis managed to get messages out on Monday about their situation. “Sadly at this point we have not been able to land the helicopter in Lemago on Tuesday. I have tried to connect with her all day, but without success. Our helicopter flew over them and they have moved together with the whole village to higher ground. They seem to have got some organisational structure going,” said Mercy Air pilot, Joel Baerstschi.
