 MBOMBELA –  They can be left feeling angry, depressed and bewildered. Basil Anthony, father of Marvin Anthony (34), who was last seen on February 16 in Nelsville, is experiencing this first-hand.
Friends and family of June Dreyer (29), who went missing on January 8, are also facing the same trauma. “The last place we saw on video footage was Marvin leaving the house at 19:00. On the camera we could see he was wearing a jersey and shorts. I could not tell the colour of his clothes, as it does not show.” He said one eyewitness told them Marvin was last seen behind the bottle store with a woman named Prileen. He got into a white vehicle and drove off. June Dreyer “Some people told us he is in Johannesburg. But there are too many people telling us different things.”
But not even Marvin’s closest friends have heard from him since. “This is not like him. He would always call someone.”
Damien Crous, who is the father of Dreyer’s one-year-old, dropped her off to do shopping in White River. “I gave her R800 and she put the money in her bra, as she did not have her handbag. When I got home I waited for her to call. Then I saw her phone was in the house, on a charger,” he said. Dreyer was last wearing black shorts, a striped vest and flip-flops. She has a tattoo on her left foot.
Crous reported Dreyer missing to the police. The organisation Pink Ladies sent out a national alert concerning her disappearance. White River SAPS spokesman,
Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo said there was no new information regarding her missing person’s case. Anyone with any information regarding Dreyer can contact the investigating officer, Det PX Ngobe, on 073-306-1140 or
060-606-5279. Anyone with information on Marvin is to contact his father, Basil, on 082-801-3619.
