 Summerhill Prep hosted a successful and very well-organised independent schools athletics event on the sport fields of Numbi Primary on Saturday February 16 Success was further attributed to the weather playing its part and the commitment and input of staff and teachers. Because of the size difference between the 10 schools as far as pupil numbers go, they did not look at final points to see which school won. “This was more an opportunity for like-minded schools to let their children compete in a healthy environment,” said Summerhill headmaster Cheryl Calmeier. The following individual achievements were recognised: • Junior victor ludorum – Aodhan Williams • Junior victrix ludorum – Gita van der Leek • Best boys’ sprint performance – Siyavuya Mnisi • Best boys’ middle distance performance – Bruce Nel • Best boys’ field performance – Unati Mashabane • Senior victor ludorum – Willow Yeowat • Senior victrix ludorum – Lys Banza • Best girls’ sprint performance – Mariam Moshood • Best girls’ middle distance performance – Siyanda Xaba • Best girls’ field performance – Bernica Lourens. Summerhill children who brought medals home are: • Emmanuel Mashile and Tanaka Gumbo (u/7) were first and second in the 60-metre race • Emmanuel Mashile, Tanaka Gumbo, Katelin Stoltz and Shammah Muhlanga were second in the u/7 relay race • Sphesihle Nxumalo (u/10) was third in the 1 200 metres • Shanique Dube (u/10) won the shot-put and was second in high jump • Tannur Calaca (u/10) was second in shot-put • Keletile Mnisi was second in the open 800-metre race. Various companies contributed in many ways to help make the day run smoothly, with Ndlovu SPAR being the main sponsor. Others are Numbi Ford, BUCO, JMG Group, Hazyview Hospitality Group, Sabi River Ice, Spesplan, Matumi Distributors, BB Feeds, Michem, Shiloh Coffee, CANSA, Rieba, Numbi Primary and Hoërskool Rob Ferreira. “My thanks go out to all of the involved parties. It is one of the advantages of being in a small community where everyone pulls together for a common goal,” Calmeier said.
